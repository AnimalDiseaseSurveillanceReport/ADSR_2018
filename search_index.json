["introduction.html", "Introduction 0.1 Passive surveillance 0.2 Climate change 0.3 The report", " Introduction In an animal health context, surveillance broadly refers to the collection, processing and timely dissemination of animal health information. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has a central role in animal health surveillance in Ireland. Surveillance is carried out for many reasons, and the information collected comes in many forms. For a relatively small number of diseases, the surveillance is initiated centrally by DAFM or other bodies such as Animal Health Ireland. This surveillance is known as active surveillance, and it is typically achieved through coordinated testing programmes. The reasons for active surveillance include control of high-impact diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), disease eradication as in the case of bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and BVD, and proof of freedom from diseases which could potentially affect trade, such as enzootic bovine leukosis and bluetongue. 0.1 Passive surveillance Passive surveillance refers to surveillance initiated by the observers of animals. It encompasses both the reporting of notifiable diseases to the authorities and the voluntary submission of carcases and samples to veterinary laboratories. Passive surveillance has been, and continues to be, Ireland’s mainstay in detecting animal diseases. A key role of the laboratories operated by DAFM and others is to provide those working with animals, such as livestock owners and veterinary practitioners with the diagnostic support required to inform their work. While this supporting role can be invaluable to the farmers and vets availing of it, veterinary laboratories are also a critical part of the national infrastructure required for early detection of new/emerging or exotic diseases (i.e. diseases which are not currently present in Ireland). Although the probability of incursion of an exotic disease at any given time may be very low, the consequences of such an event are potentially very significant. Therefore, although less visible to stakeholders, the role of the laboratories in vigilance for exotic diseases is arguably even more important to the wider agri-food industry in safeguarding animal health and export trade. 0.2 Climate change The long hot summer of 2018 appears to have had a positive effect on the overall health of livestock. It also posed challenges for many farmers in the south and east of the country - in ensuring that livestock had continued access to drinking water and both sufficient summer pasture and enough winter fodder with such an extended period of poor grass growth. While the attribution of an increasing number of unusual weather events like long hot summers and severe storms to climate change is a matter of debate, there is now a broad societal acceptance of the concept of climate change induced by human activity, and of the urgent need for climate action, with agriculture receiving particular attention in respect of both mitigation and adaptation. Improving the efficiency of livestock production as a possible means to reduce the carbon footprint per kilogram of meat or milk produced is one key aspect of mitigating the impact of farming. Therefore laboratory diagnostic support is likely to be needed more than ever to provide the information that farmers and their vets will need to prevent and control diseases, thereby minimising morbidity and mortality and maximising productivity. Climate change may also play a more direct role in increasing risks to animal health if it allows for an expansion in the geographic range, abundance and/or activity of arthropod vectors of livestock diseases which heretofore have been exotic to Ireland - yet another reason for robust surveillance. 0.3 The report It is in this context that we present the 2018 Animal Disease Surveillance Report. While it conveys something of the scale and range of laboratory activities undertaken every year, this report cannot adequately reflect the effort and dedication of those behind the scenes in the provision of laboratory diagnostic services, nor the challenges inherent in extracting meaningful surveillance information from a voluntary diagnostic caseload. We must also acknowledge the critical role played by our clients (farmers and vets) who, by making the effort to avail of laboratory services, are not only taking full responsibility for the health and welfare of the animals under their own care, but are also indirectly contributing to the store of knowledge available to the wider community in maintaining the favourable health and welfare status of the national herd. Finally, a particular word of thanks to Cosme Sánchez-Miguel, whose tireless efforts have ensured the timely production of this report. We are pleased to commend this report to our readers.

["diseases-of-cattle-overview.html", "Section 1 Diseases of Cattle Overview 1.1 Neonatal Calves (birth to one month of age) 1.2 Calves (one to five months of age) 1.3 Weanlings (six months to one year of age) 1.4 Adult Cattle (over 12 months of age)", " Section 1 Diseases of Cattle Overview Jim O’Donovan, Research Officer, Cork Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Model Fam Road, Bishoptown, Cork, Ireland The Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs) of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) are engaged primarily in scanning (passive) surveillance by gathering data from post-mortem and clinical sample submissions. Analysis of this data provides an insight into trends of disease incidence and causes of mortality on Irish farms, thereby informing decision-making relevant to disease control at a national level. Tables and charts are generated with test results and post-mortem diagnoses from voluntary submissions of material (carcasses and clinical samples) to RVLs by farmers through their private veterinary practitioners (PVPs). Therefore, it should be noted that data reflects only those cases where PVPs considered it appropriate to request laboratory investigation and the herdowner was motivated to deliver the carcass to an RVL. This section presents the most commonly diagnosed causes of death in cattle presented for post-mortem examination at RVLs. The range of diagnoses of animals submitted for post-mortem examination varies according to age of the animal, thus the results in this section are presented by age category. In order to facilitate presentation and comparison, conditions which affect given systems have been grouped together. During 2018, 2902 cattle carcasses were submitted for examination. Geographical distribution of herds submitting bovine cases, colour coded by RVL where the carcases were examined, is illustrated in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1: Distribution of bovine carcasses. Bovine carcasses (excluding foetuses), aggregated and mapped at their DED (District Electoral Division) and colour-coded by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory of submission (n= 2902 ) 1.1 Neonatal Calves (birth to one month of age) The trend of gastrointestinal infections being the most frequently diagnosed cause of death in neonatal calves continued in 2018 (Table 1.1 &amp; Figure @ref(fig:neonetalfig}). The deaths of almost thirty per cent of calves in this age group were attributed to gastrointestinal infections. Not surprisingly, a number of these cases had hypogammaglobulinaemia recorded as well, indicating failure of passive transfer of humoral immunity from dam to calf. Systemic infections (sepsis) continued as the second most frequently diagnosed cause of death in DAFM laboratories. In the last three years, systemic infections reached a peak of 24 per cent of deaths in 2016 (DAFM 2016), but in 2018 the percentage of neonatal calves with systemic infections fell to 17.8 per cent. Table 1.1: Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of bovine neonatal calves in 2018 (n= 845 ). Category No. of Cases Percentage GIT Infections 253 29.9 Systemic Infections 150 17.8 Respiratory Infections 97 11.5 Navel Ill/Joint Ill 65 7.7 Nutritional/metabolic conditions 53 6.3 Hereditary and developmental abnormality 50 5.9 GIT torsion/obstruction 35 4.1 GIT ulcer/perforation/foreign body 25 3.0 Diagnosis not reached 24 2.8 Peritonitis 18 2.1 Integument/Musculoskeletal 13 1.5 Unclassified 11 1.3 Cardiac/circulatory conditions 9 1.1 Fractures/Calving injuries 8 1.0 Liver disease 5 0.6 Urinary Tract conditions 5 0.6 Bovine Neonatal Pancytopaenia 4 0.5 CNS 4 0.5 Trauma 4 0.5 Abscessation 3 0.4 BVD/Mucosal disease 3 0.4 Poisoning 2 0.2 Reproductive Tract Conditions 2 0.2 Clostridial disease 1 0.1 Tick Borne Fever 1 0.1 Navel ill/ joint ill has stayed at a level consistent with previous years at 7.7 per cent. Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes were the infectious agents most frequently isolated. Similarly, the rate of peritonitis cases has stayed at 2.1 per cent, with Trueperella pyogenes and Escherichia coli commonly isolated from such cases. Respiratory infections are normally responsible for about one in ten deaths in neonatal calves, and at 11.5 per cent, 2018 was a typical year. Nutritional and metabolic conditions equate to 6.3 per cent of diagnoses in neonatal calves. This category includes failure of passive transfer of humoral immunity (hypogammaglobulinaemia) and ruminal milk drinking. Hereditary and developmental abnormalities were recorded in DAFM laboratories in almost 6 per cent of carcasses submitted. Common diagnoses in this category include intestinal atresia and cardiac defects. Cardiac abnormalities most commonly noted were ventricular and atrial septum defects and persistent patent foramen ovale (Figure 1.3). Figure 1.2: Diagnoses of neonatal calves. Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of bovine neonatal calves in 2018 (n= 845 ). Figure 1.3: Septal defect.

Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. 1.2 Calves (one to five months of age) Respiratory infections are by far the biggest cause of mortality among 1–5 month old calves in Ireland (Table 1.2 &amp; Figure 1.4). They accounted for 34.3 per cent of deaths in this age group. Examination of data for the last few years shows that respiratory infections are responsible for an increasing percentage of deaths in this age category, though this has leveled off recently. The percentage of respiratory infections in this age category has risen by approximately 8 per cent since 2014. A breakdown of detected agents in these cases is presented in the Bovine Respiratory Disease section of this report. Table 1.2: Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of calves (1-5 months old) in 2018 (n= 669 ) Category No. of Cases Percentage Respiratory Infections 235 34.3 GIT Infections 91 13.3 GIT torsion/obstruction 56 8.2 Systemic Infections 52 7.6 GIT ulcer/perforation/foreign body 42 6.1 Nutritional/metabolic conditions 33 4.8 Diagnosis not reached 30 4.4 Clostridial disease 22 3.2 CNS 20 2.9 Poisoning 14 2.0 Navel Ill/Joint Ill 13 1.9 Peritonitis 13 1.9 Cardiac/circulatory conditions 12 1.8 Urinary Tract conditions 12 1.8 Hereditary and developmental abnormality 9 1.3 Tuberculosis 8 1.2 Integument/Musculoskeletal 7 1.0 Gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) infections (13.3 per cent) and systemic infections (7.6 per cent) remain similar to the trend of previous years as the second and third most frequently diagnosed conditions accounting for one in five of diagnosed causes of death. Common bacterial agents implicated include Salmonella enterica Dublin and Escherichia coli. Coccidia (Eimeria spp.) are the most frequently detected GIT pathogens in this age group. Figure 1.4: Diagnoses of calves. Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of calves (1–5 months old) in 2018 (n= 669 ) Navel ill/ joint ill, consequences of navel infections at birth, were diagnosed in 1.9 per cent of calves in this age group presented to DAFM laboratories. Diagnosis of peritonitis in this age category has remained at a consistent level, between 1 and 3 per cent, from 2014 to 2018. GIT ulcers and perforations continued to be a frequent diagnosis in 2018 accounting for 8.2 per cent of diagnoses. Perforating abomasal ulcers, leading to leakage of stomach contents and peritonitis, accounted for the majority of these cases (Figure 1.5). GIT torsion/obstruction was recorded in 8.2 per cent of calves. Torsions of intestines, full mesentery, abomasum, omasum and reticulum were recorded. There was no fluctuation in their occurrence from previous years. Nutritional and metabolic conditions were diagnosed in 4.8 per cent of calves. The leading diagnoses in this category were ruminal acidosis and malnutrition. Figure 1.5: Fibrinous peritonitis. Peritonitis resulting from a perforating abomasal ulcer (inset). Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. 1.3 Weanlings (six months to one year of age) As in previous years, respiratory infections were the most commonly diagnosed cause of mortality (32.3 per cent) in this age group (Table 1.3 &amp; Figure 1.7. GIT infections were identified as the second most common cause of death in six to 12 month-old weanlings in Ireland at 21.6 per cent. Clostridial diseases were the third biggest grouping of cause of mortality in this age group (8.7 per cent). Figure 1.6: Clostridial myositis (blackleg). Muscular necrosis and oedema in the gluteus muscle of a weanling. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) were diagnosed in 2.1 per cent of carcases in Ireland in 2018. Diseases in this category include cerebro-cortical necrosis, encephalopathies, encephalitis/meningitis and thrombotic meningo-encephalitis. Table 1.3: Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of weanlings (6–12 months old) in 2018 (n= 396 ) Category No. of Cases Percentage Respiratory Infections 138 32.3 GIT Infections 92 21.6 Clostridial disease 37 8.7 Diagnosis not reached 37 8.7 Systemic Infections 22 5.2 Poisoning 14 3.3 Cardiac/circulatory conditions 11 2.6 Nutritional/metabolic conditions 11 2.6 Integument/Musculoskeletal 10 2.3 CNS 9 2.1 Tuberculosis 9 2.1 GIT torsion/obstruction 6 1.4 Figure 1.7: Diagnoses in weanlings.

This incidence has remained roughly static in Ireland since 2014. Cardiac/circulatory system conditions were the second biggest diagnosis in adult cattle in Ireland, occurring in 8.7 per cent of cases. Endocarditis, pericarditis, caudal vena cava thrombosis, haemorrhage and haemolysis were common diagnoses in this category. T. pyogenes was regularly isolated from cases of endocarditis, pericarditis and caudal vena cava thrombosis. Figure 1.8: Diagnoses of adult cattle. Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of adult cattle (over 12 months old) in 2018 (n= 527 ) Clostridial disease only accounted for 5.3 per cent of adult cattle deaths diagnosed and included cases of blackleg (Figure 1.6), malignant oedema, botulism and tetanus. Cases of GIT ulceration/perforation and foreign body accounted for 4.3 per cent of deaths, a slight decrease on rates in previous years. Hardware disease or traumatic reticuloperitionitis account for a significant proportion of these cases every year. Peritonitis diagnoses equated to 5.2 per cent in Ireland, in keeping with the trend of previous years. References "],

Clinical JD is characterised by diarrhoea and progressive cachexia and ultimately results in death. In total, seventy seven positive MAP faecal cultures, from 53 different herds, were recorded in 2018 (Figure 2.2). Ten herds had more than one positive culture, with seven being the highest number of MAP faecal positive cultures in one single farm. Over 90 per cent of positive animals were female. A mixture of dairy and beef breeds recorded positive results. However, almost 30 per cent of positive samples were from Holstein Friesians (Table 2.1). Table 2.1: Summary of 2018 MAP positive faecal cultures by breed and gender Breed Female Male Total Holstein Friesian 22 (31.0) 1 (16.7) 23 (29.9) Limousin 12 (16.9) 1 (16.7) 13 (16.9) Charolais 9 (12.7) 0 (0.0) 9 (11.7) Friesian 8 (11.3) 0 (0.0) 8 (10.4) Jersey 8 (11.3) 0 (0.0) 8 (10.4) Aberdeen Angus 4 (5.6) 3 (50.0) 7 (9.1) Belgian Blue 3 (4.2) 0 (0.0) 3 (3.9) Shorthorn 1 (1.4) 1 (16.7) 2 (2.6) Blonde D’Aquitaine 1 (1.4) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.3) Hereford 1 (1.4) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.3) Norwegian Red 1 (1.4) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.3) Partanaise Cross 1 (1.4) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.3) Latency is a common feature of mycobacterial diseases, animals can remain sub-clinically infected without showing any clinical signs of the disease for many years. Clinical disease is reported to occur most frequently in cattle aged 2–5 years. In line with this, based on a number of assumptions, it is estimated that 50 per cent of animals that tested positive in 2018 were displaying symptoms of JD by four years of age (Figure 2.3). At time of analysis, all male animals that had a positive result in 2018 were no longer alive and only 24 per cent of positive female animals were still alive (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.1: Thickened and wrinkled intestinal mucosa (granulomatous enteritis) in the ileum of a cow with Johne’s disease (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis). Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Figure 2.2: Number of herds by county with at least one animal diagnosed with JD by faecal mycobacterial culture in 2018. 2.1 JD transmission In many herds, initial introduction of MAP usually occurs as result of acquiring an infected but clinically normal animal. In 2018, a number of animals that subsequently recorded MAP faecal culture positive results underwent multiple herd movements throughout their lifetime, potentially allowing spread of the disease. Five was the greatest number of herd movements recorded by a positive animal, excluding movements to factory or knackery (Table 2.2). Table 2.2: Movement statistics excluding movements to factory or knackery. Minimun Median Maximun 0 1 5 Once MAP is introduced to a herd, infection with MAP is understood to occur, primarily, as a calf. Animals younger than six months are believed to be the most susceptible. Neonates are considered to be at highest risk of acquiring MAP infection due to increased permeability of intestines during the first 24 hours of life and an immature immune system. Older animals are believed to be less susceptible; however, infection can still occur (Windsor and Whittington 2010). Severity and rate of JD progression in individual animals are dependent on MAP exposure dose and age at time of infection. Infection usually occurs via the faecal-oral route, although in-utero transmission can also occur. Exposure of calves to adult faeces is the most important risk factor in MAP transmission (Doré et al. 2012). Faecal-oral transmission is facilitated by faecal contamination of feedstuff and calf’s environment, with highest environmental risk factors for neonatal infection being faecal contamination of udders and calving pens. Colostrum and milk from infected cows can also contain quantities of MAP capable of infecting calves. Feeding pooled colostrum or milk from multiple cows of unknown MAP status is considered to increase risk of infection within a herd. Figure 2.3: Survival curves measure how much time elapsed before a certain event occurred. In this case, the event is represented by submission of a faecal sample to an RVL. An assumption is made that faecal samples are submitted soon after the animal displays diarrheoa unresponsive to treatment. 50 % of animals may have displayed symptoms consistent with the disease by four years of age. The graph on the bottom represents number of animals at risk of developing symptoms over time.

As MAP is a slow growing bacterium, infection can remain latent for many years making diagnosis difficult. Diagnostic tests currently in use involve either identification of MAP itself (culture), identification of MAP genetic elements (PCR), or detection of the immune response MAP infection elicits (ELISA) (Behr and Collins 2010). Faecal culture is generally taken as the reference test for MAP. An advantage of culture is that detection of MAP in faecal samples confirms presence of viable MAP in an animal. Due to absent or intermittent shedding of bacteria early in the disease process, sensitivity of culture can be low. Specificity, however, is almost 100 per cent. Due to the fastidious nature of MAP, culture takes a number of weeks. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is another faecal based test used to detect DNA of MAP, it offers a rapid method of detecting MAP status. Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) examines the host’s immune response to MAP and is extensively used for routine diagnosis. ELISA is favoured as a screening test due to its relatively low cost, compared to faecal culture or PCR. ELISAs also provide faster results when compared to culture methods. ELISA relies on identifying serum antibodies to a particular antigen as an indicator of infection. It is important to note that a positive ELISA reaction is NOT confirmation of JD. The specificity of MAP ELISA tests can be influenced by tuberculin testing and by exposure to non-MAP environmental mycobacteria (giving rise to false positive results). The sensitivity of MAP ELISA tests is influenced by stage of infection, high in animals with clinical disease but low in infected animals that are shedding few MAP organisms (where false negative results may arise). 2.3 Post mortem examination On post mortem, gross and microscopic lesions associated with JD are primarily confined to the intestine and mesenteric and ileo-caecal lymph nodes. Gross lesions are characterised by thickening and corrugation of intestinal mucosa, most prominent in distal ileum and ileo-caecal valve. Histological lesions associated with JD can vary widely; villi are frequently fused and mucosa is invariably thickened, infiltration of macrophages -including giant cells- is commonly identified in the submucosa and acid fast bacilli are commonly present. JD cannot be diagnosed solely on post mortem, diagnosis needs to be confirmed by faecal culture and/or histology (intestine/lymph nodes). 2.4 Control Programme A voluntary national JD control programme is on-going in Ireland under the guidance of Animal Health Ireland. The aim is to provide pathways for test-negative and test-positive herds to demonstrate progress towards an improved herd assurance for JD. Primary aspects of this programme involve identification of potentially infected animals via either milk or blood ELISA testing, confirmation relying on faecal based testing. Highlighting on farm management practices using veterinary risk assessment and management plans (VRAMP) is commonly used as a tool in a number of control programmes, including AHI’s JD control programme. VRAMP is a combined work between a farmer and a trained local vet familiar with his/her farm which facilitates identifying specific high risk management practices occurring in such farm that may facilitate spread of JD. Repeat visits allow monitoring of successful implementation of management changes. 2.4.1 Acknowledgement Dr Kevin Kenny (TB Section, DAFM) for providing the JD dataset and Alma Wilson (Cork RVL, DAFM) for sorting out this data for analysis.

They also cause disease in other species including goats and pigs. Typically, clostridial disease presents as acute disease or sudden death and mortality approaches 100% in most cases. 3.1 Blackleg Blackleg is the most frequently diagnosed clostridial disease in bovine submissions; it is commonly, but not exclusively, associated with detection of Clostridium chauvoei (Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3). The pathogenesis of this disease requires pre-existence of bacteria in tissue that, in conjunction with favourable circumstances such as trauma, establish anaerobic conditions which allow bacterial proliferation and toxin production, the latter causes severe local necrotising myositis (Figure 3.1) and systemic toxaemia. Cases encountered in post-mortem rooms frequently have a typical rancid butter odour and affect muscles of the limbs, tongue and heart. Figure 3.1: Blackleg lesion (severe necrotising myositis) in the hindquarters of a bullock. Photo: Maresa Sheehan. Table 3.1: Clostridial disease diagnosed in bovine carcasses in 2018 (n= 88 ).

Clostridium botulinum toxin typically results in affected animals lying in sternal recumbancy with the head on the ground or turned into the flank, similar to a cow suffering from post parturient hypocalcaemia/milk fever. However, a range of clinical signs can be detected within an affected group, likely reflecting levels of toxin ingested, these can include restlessness, inco-ordination and knuckling. The association of this disease with the spread of poultry litter has resulted in Codes of Practice being established for disposal of such material. The laboratory service has been involved in the investigation of a number of cases where a direct link with poultry litter was not established, carrion and forage associated botulism could not be ruled out in these cases. 3.3 Malignant Oedema Malignant oedema can be caused by a number of Clostridial spp. including C. septicum, chauvoei, sordellii and novyi. Epidemiology and pathogenesis of this disease differs from blackleg in that bacteria is introduced through a wound and causes focally extensive skin gangrene and oedema of the sub-cutaneous and intra-muscular connective tissue, there is less frequent involvement of underlying muscle. Figure 3.2: Perivascular oedema in the brain associated with vascular compromise due to Epsilon toxin-Pulpy kidney. Photo: Maresa Sheehan. Figure 3.3: Clostridial disease diagnosed in Bovine carcasses in 2018 (n= 88 ). 3.4 Enterotoxaemia Enterotoxaemia is a disease caused by Clostridium perfringens that causes significant losses in both cattle and sheep (Table 3.2) and Figure 3.5). This micro-organism can be a normal inhabitant in the intestine of most species inlcuding humans. When intestinal environment is altered by sudden changes in diet or other factors, C. perfringens proliferates in large numbers and produces several potent toxins that are absorbed into the general circulation or act locally with usually devastating effects on the host. Enterotoxaemia diagnosis presents a diagnostic challenge as this bacteria is a normal inhabitant of the gut, therefore, demonstration of toxins is essential. However, as some of the toxins can be present in small amounts in clinically normal animals, presence of concurrent gross lesions and histopathological changes is desirable.

In cattle, it has been associated with haemorrhagic enteritis, indistinguishable from that caused by Types B and C. It has also been proposed as a cause of acute deaths in calves due to clostridial abomasitis and of jejunal haemorrhage syndrome in adult cows. The latter is a disease entity sporadically diagnosed in the veterinary laboratory service and, consequently, no definitive conclusions on its aetiology can be made (Van Kruiningen et al. 2009,Songer and Miskimins (2005)). Clostridium Perfringens Type B and C can cause sudden death, with or without haemorrhagic enteritis, in lambs and calves, and struck in adult sheep. Clostridium perfringens Type D produces epsilon toxin, which causes vascular endothelial damage (Figure 3.2) resulting in typical lesions of Focal Symmetrical Encephalomalacia (FSE) and pulpy kidney. In the PM room, detection of fibrin clots in fluid of the pericardial sac (Figure 3.4) is a strong indicator of epsilon toxin involvement. 3.5 Black Disease Black Disease is a less frequently diagnosed cause of acute or sudden death in cattle and sheep. Clostridium novyi proliferates in anaerobic conditions, typically associated with liver damage due to Fasciola hepatica migration. Multifocal areas of hepatic necrosis are observed at post mortem. Pathogenesis of bacillary haemoglobinuria is similar, although in addition to multifocal hepatic necrosis and vascular damage, the organism also produces an haemolytic toxin which causes haemoglobinuria. Clostridium haemolyticum should be included in the list of differentials for haemoglobinuria, which also includes Babesiosis, periparturient hypophosphataemia, copper poisoning in sheep and brassica poisoning amongst others. Figure 3.5: Clostridial diseases diagnosed in Ovine carcasses in 2018 (n= 101 ). 3.6 Braxy Braxy is caused by Clostridium septicum and is typically seen in animals submitted after grazing frozen/snow covered pasture. It causes necrosis, ulceration, congestion and emphysema of the abomasal wall. 3.7 Clostridial abomasitis Abomasitis caused by Clostridium sordellii has a similar post mortem presentation. Histopathology will reveal a severe necrotising abomasitis (Figure 3.6) with intra-lesional bacilli. It is essential that gross signs and histopathology concur with isolation/FAT detection of bacteria, as C. sordellii and septicum are normal inhabitants of the gut. Figure 3.6: Haemorrhagic and emphysematous abomasitis associated with Clostridium sordellii. Photo: Maresa Sheehan. 3.8 Clostridial Vaccination Vaccination using a multivalent vaccine is recommended for protection of animals against clostridial diseases. Due to the ubiquitous nature of agents involved, vaccination should be considered an essential component of herd/flock management. However, in a recent study into sheep mortality by regional veterinary laboratories, fifteen flocks that reported vaccinating against clostridial disease recorded a clostridial disease diagnosis. This finding is not wholly unexpected as vaccination of flocks does not infer sterile immunity, nor does detection of a pathogen on postmortem necessarily infers causation. Without data on vaccine storage, administration frequency or checks to validate that all submitted animals actually received the vaccine, it is impossible to be more specific about the reasons for these findings. However, it can be speculated that at least some clostridial disease in lambs may be due to insufficient maternal transfer of immunity to newborn lambs or waning of passive immunity in older lambs. Uzal and Songer (2008) and Songer and Miskimins (2005) reported that, although widely used, there can be variations in individual responses or manufacturer’s vaccine quality, when determining the response of sheep flocks to multivalent clostridial vaccination (Murray et al. 2019).

Meath Neonatal enteritis is consistently the most frequently diagnosed cause of mortality in calves less than one month old in the Republic of Ireland. It is generally caused by the interaction of one or more infectious enteric pathogens and several predisposing factors. 4.1 Neonatal enteritis The most common clinical presentation in neonatal enteritis is watery diarrhoea (occasionally containing blood) usually leading to dehydration and, in severe cases, progressing to profound weakness and death. In order to identify the enteric pathogens involved in cases of neonatal calf diarrhoea, a series of tests are performed on faecal samples collected at post mortem from affected calf carcases or submitted by veterinary practitioners from clinical cases. Approximately 1800 such faecal samples were examined in DAFM laboratories in 2018 (Table 4.1). This section shows the most common infectious agents diagnosed in calves less than one month old. The relative frequency of identification of pathogens in calf faecal samples in the Republic of Ireland in 2018 is plotted in Figure 4.2. Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. were the most common pathogens identified while E coli K99, coronavirus and Salmonella Dublin were recorded relatively infrequently. Table 4.1: Number of tests and relative frequency of enteropathogenic agents identified in faecal samples of calves up to one month of age in 2018.

Photo: Cosme Sanchez-Miguel. 4.1.1 Rotavirus enteritis Rotavirus (34.09 per cent) has consistently been the most frequently identified pathogen in calf faecal samples in the Republic of Ireland in recent years, its frequency ranging from 30–35 per cent between 2010 and 2018 (Figure 4.4). Calves are most susceptible to rotavirus enteritis up to three weeks of age. Adult animals are the primary source of rotavirus infection for neonatal calves. The severity of clinical signs depends on several factors including the age of the animal and the immune status of the calf, the latter depends on the absorption of colostral antibodies immediately after birth. Rotavirus targets villi in the upper small intestine causing shortening and fusion of such villi, this results in malabsorption and leads to diarrhoea. Death may ensue due to acidosis, dehydration and starvation. Figure 4.2: Bovine Neonatal Enteritis. Relative frequency of enteropathogenic agents identified in calf faecal samples tested in 2018. 4.1.2 Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidium parvum is a small single-cell parasite which causes damage to intestinal epithelial cells of the lower small intestine resulting in mild to severe enteritis, typically affecting calves during their second week of life. Affected calves excrete large numbers of oocysts which are highly resistant and can survive in the environment up to several months under favourable conditions. Transmission between animals is by faecal-oral route, often via a contaminated environment. Control of the parasite is best achieved by strict maintenance of good calf housing hygiene practices and avoiding mixing animals of different ages. Ammonia-based disinfectants are most effective. The prophylactic use of drugs such as halofuginone lactate may also be useful. In addition to causing disease in animals, Cryptosporidium spp. has the potential to cause zoonotic disease especially in immunocompromised humans; therefore farm workers should take appropriate hygiene precautions when handling calves. 4.1.3 Coronavirus enteritis Calves are most susceptible to coronavirus enteritis between one and three weeks of age. Coronavirus preferentially infects enterocytes in the lower small intestines and colon, typically resulting in blunting and fusion of villi and mild enterocolitis. 4.1.4 Escherichia coli K99 E. coli K99 is an enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and an important cause of neonatal enteritis in very young calves, typically less than three days of age. These strains of E. coli preferentially colonise the lower small intestine and produce toxins that cause secretion of water and electrolytes from the intestinal mucosa, resulting in rapid dehydration. The percentage prevalence of E. coli K99 would likely be higher if testing for this enteric pathogen was restricted to animals younger than one week old. 4.1.5 Salmonella Dublin Salmonella enterica subsp.enterica serovar Dublin (Salmonella Dublin) is the most common Salmonella serotype that affects calves in the Republic of Ireland and was isolated in 0.91 per cent of neonatal faecal samples cultured in 2018. The relative frequency of detection of Salmonella Dublin from such cases has fallen significantly over the past decade from 3.4 per cent in 2011 to 0.9 per cent in 2018 (Figure 4.4). It is not clear why this has occurred. Salmonella Dublin infection has a number of clinical presentations in neonatal calves including acute enteritis, osteomyelitis and septicaemia/systemic disease. Salmonella enteritis is characterised by watery mucoid diarrhoea with presence of fibrin and blood. While Salmonella can cause diarrhoea in both adult cattle and calves, infection is more common and often more severe in calves from 10 days to 3 months old. In addition, calves can shed the organism for variable periods of time and/or intermittently depending on the degree of infection (carrier state). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} The basic principles for the prevention and control of neonatal enteritis are enhancing host immunity and reducing the load of enteric pathogens in the environment. The importance of good colostrum management, leading to an adequate passive immunity transfer, in the prevention of calf diarrhoea is a given. An average 40 Kg calf requires 3 litres of colostrum within 2–4 hours of birth. Thereafter, appropriate nutrition of young calves, including diarrhoeic calves, is essential. Calves should be grouped according to age on dry clean bedding and avoiding high stocking density. There should be good hygiene practices including appropriate disinfection between batches and rapid isolation and treatment of sick calves. Colostral and milk antibodies against certain bacterial and viral enteric agents can be enhanced by vaccination of the cows during the dry period (passive immunisation). 4.1.6 Campylobacter jejuni C. jejuni was found in almost 8.88 per cent of neonatal calf faecal samples tested in 2018. It is not considered pathogenic for cattle. However, it is routinely surveyed in neonatal faecal samples because it is a zoonosis and a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Therefore, appropriate hygiene precautions should be taken by personnel handling stock. 4.1.7 Giardia spp. Giardia spp. is one of the most prevalent and widespread intestinal protozoan parasite in humans and several vertebrate animal species worldwide. The clinical significance of Giardia spp. as enteric pathogen in calves is questionable. While eight strains are recognized, only two strains are thought to be transferable to humans (A&amp;B) and thus potentially zoonotic (Thompson 2004). Appropriate precautions should be taken by calf handlers. 4.1.8 Coccidiosis Coccidiosis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria spp. Only three (Eimeria bovis, Eimeria alabamensis and Eimeria zuernii) out of twelve bovine coocidia species are pathogenic. Some of the non-pathogenic or weakly pathogenic species are capable of producing massive numbers of oocysts, therefore faecal coccidial occyst counts need to be interpreted in conjunction with history and clinical findings. Coccidia damage the epithelial cells lining of the gut causing diarrhoea and possibly dysentery. Table 4.2: Number of tests and relative frequency of coccidiosis in faecal samples of calves up to one month of age in 2018. No. of Tests Positive Percentage 610 107 18 Coccidiosis is particularly common in calves between three weeks and six months of age but it can occur in older animals also. Calves become infected when placed in environments contaminated by older cattle or other infected calves, e.g. indoors on bedding, outdoors around drinking and feeding troughs. Poor hygiene, high stocking density and poor health and nutrition will all contribute to a calf becoming infected. The frequency of detection of coccidiosis in neonatal calves less than 1 month old in the Republic of Ireland in 2018 was 18 per cent (Table 4.2). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Often, peak coccidia oocyst-shedding does not correlate with the onset of diarrhoea in calves. Detection of Coccidia spp. in faecal samples is facilitated by sampling pre-clinical comrade animals as well as those showing clinical signs.

The adequate delivery of good quality colostrum is an important part of calf management, as transfer of immunity provides protection to neonates from common infectious diseases that contribute to illness and death. 5.1 ZST test and the importance of colostrum Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is best assessed on a herd basis. It is recommended to sample several healthy calves or lambs, up to twelve animals less than a week old. Blood sampling should not be done on the first day of life as peak circulating immunoglobulin is achieved 36 hours after colostrum ingestion. The ZST test used in the DAFM laboratory service was developed by McEwan et al. (1970), who determined that metal salts such as Zinc Sulphate would be precipitated from solution in proportion to the level of immunoglobulin present in a serum sample, once the two are combined. In recent years, to improve the quality of this test, a higher concentration of Zinc Sulphate solution has been used (Hudgens et al. 1996). Table 5.1: Zinc Sulphate Turbidity Test Results in 2018 (n= 1207 ). Submission type Status No. of samples Mean Percentage Diagnostic Optimal 588 33.0 72 Adequate 120 16.4 15 Inadequate 106 7.4 13 Carcass Optimal 132 29.7 34 Adequate 89 15.5 23 Inadequate 172 6.4 44 5.2 Outline of 2018 figures In 2018, 814 blood samples were submitted for Zinc Sulphate Turbidity Test for diagnosic purposes, i.e. from live animals. Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1 show that 72 per cent of samples submitted for diagnostic purposes were in the optimal range, i.e. had a ZST result greater than or equal to 20 units; 15 per cent were within the adequate range, ZST results between 12.5 and 20 units, and the remaining 13 per cent were in the inadequate range, ZST results below 12.5 units. The distribution of ZST values is charted in Figure 5.2. 2018 figures are a marked improvement on just a few years ago, for example in 2014 only 51 per cent of diagnostic samples returned a value greater than or equal to 20 units. There are two likely reasons for this improvement: information campaigns conducted by several bodies to impress upon herd-owners the importance of good colostrum management, which are likely to have led to improved colostrum feeding practices, and better targeted testing of calves to evaluate colostrum management. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Measurement of serum total protein is another way to assess for failure of passive transfer (FPT). This test is useful for monitoring colostrum management in healthy calves, but it is not suitable for sick, dehydrated or dying calves. The analysis can be carried out either in farms with a refractometer (Figure 5.3, or in veterinary clinics using an in-house biochemistry analyser (Bielmann et al. 2010). When used for screening, 80 per cent of samples should show values above 55 g/l. 5.3 Shortcomings in submission practices The optimum way to investigate FPT is on a herd basis. Single samples are not ideal as individual results can vary and may not be reflective of herd incidence of FPT. Colostrum management should be examined on a herd basis; when assessing a herd, the proportion of calves in the herd which have received inadequate colostral immunity is of more significance than the average serum immunoglobulin concentration. Currently, DAFM laboratories determine the immune status of calves by ZST tests on an on-demand basis. Submissions overwhelmingly consist of a sample from a single calf; in 2018, 41 per cent of submissions for ZST testing contained one single sample and only 23 per cent of submissions contained 5 or more samples. This proportion has improved over the last few years; in 2014 single samples made up 79 per cent of submissions while only 7 per cent of submissions contained five or more samples. Awareness of the importance of colostrum in herd health, and of the need for planned investigations into the efficacy of colostrum feeding, has increased. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Clinical history provided in the laboratory submission forms is in many cases minimal but one would suspect many single samples come from sick calves. Samples from sick calves are not suitable to evaluate colostrum management as disease processes will affect circulating immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulin will be lost from circulation as it binds with antigen, or through protein-losing conditions such as enteropathy and nephropathy; dehydration, on the other hand, may lead to artificially high ZST results through haemoconcentration. Figure 5.1: Results of ZST from submitted bovine blood samples in 2018 (n= 814 ). Figure 5.2: Distribrtion of ZST test results during 2018. Optimal colostral immunity is defined as greater than 20 units (orange line), adequated between 12.5 and 20 units and inadequated less than 12.5 units (red line). The width of the white area at each point of the x axis is proportional to the number of samples returning a ZST result of that value. Outliers with values greater than 60 units (24 samples) were removed from the plot (n= 790 ). 5.4 ZST and immunoglobulin classes ZST tests give results which correlate well with levels of total immunoglobulin and with IgG, which is understandable as IgG comprises the largest proportion of immunoglobulin in both colostrum and the bloodstream of calves drinking colostrum. Results from the ZST test do not give as good a measure of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM), which composes a smaller proportion of the immunoglobulin in colostrum and is important in the prevention of septicaemia. To complicate matters, IgM molecules are commonly much larger than those of IgG and closure of the intestine to IgM, in other words the point at which the intestinal mucosa ceases absorbing IgM intact into the blood stream, occurs much earlier than it does for IgG. The upshot of this is that a calf receiving colostrum after a slight delay may have adequate, or even optimal, levels of IgG and total immunoglobulin, yet have absorbed inadequate levels of IgM. This inadequacy will not be reflected in ZST results or in results from any of the alternative indirect tests for FPT, such as total protein or Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) levels. Only a direct test for IgM, such as an ELISA or radial immunodiffusion (RID), will pick up this deficiency. Figure 5.3: Brix refractometer. Colostrum quality can be assessed by placing a drop of colostrum in the stage and looking through the eyepiece. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. 5.5 Post mortem samples Another source of samples for ZST testing in DAFM laboratories is blood harvested from calves at necropsy, which by definition are not from healthy calves. ZST results from calves sampled at necropsy, except in the case of very acute deaths, may give misleading results due to the course of illness that preceded death. However, RVL staff may use ZST results from these calves to flag possible cases of FPT in a herd, if results suggestive of FPT are returned this can prompt a possible need to investigate further the performance of colostrum management in that herd. When ZST testing was carried out on 393 samples taken from calf carcasses during post mortem examinations in the laboratory service, 44 per cent of samples had results indicating a failure of passive transfer, a further 23 per cent of samples were in the suboptimal range. 5.6 Ovine submissions Submissions from ovine neonates for ZST testing are low, especially diagnostic submissions of which only four were received in 2018. Of these, one was suggestive of FPT, but such a small sample size does not make it possible to draw conclusions. Samples were collected from lamb carcasses in higher numbers, and it was found that 96 out of 148 (or 65 per cent) were below the optimal level. Submission rates of ovine neonates for necropsy have been elevated by a study into sheep mortality which was conducted in a number of RVLs in 2018. We must again bear in mind the possible limitations of this test when performed on samples taken from dead animals. It is likely that failure of passive transfer in lambs is most commonly due to mis-mothering, the risk may be also high for lambs born as triplets. While lambs and calves from beef breeds will usually receive adequate colostrum by suckling, dairy calves require herdowner intervention in order to consume enough colostrum to give sufficient protection. This is due to a dilution effect on colostrum quality caused by the higher volumes of milk produced by modern dairy cows. Ideally, the first feed of colostrum should be given to the calf within two hours of birth and certainly no later than six hours after birth. The quantity required should be based on weight, with the typical 35–45 kg dairy calf needing 3 l and smaller cross-bred calves needing less. Poor transfer of colostral immunity may be due to poor quality colostrum, low colostral intake, poor colostrum absorption or a combination of these three factors. Supplementary feeding using a stomach tube or oesophageal feeder may be necessary. Frozen colostrum may be used when necessary. Artificial colostrum is less effective but may be used as a last resort. It should always be remembered that improved colostrum feeding practices will not completely compensate for inadequate hygiene. References "],
["bovine-abortion.html", "Section 6 Bovine Abortion 6.1 Primary Pathogens 6.2 Salmonella Dublin abortion 6.3 Protoozoal abortion 6.4 Secondary Pathogens", " Section 6 Bovine Abortion Cosme Sánchez-Miguel Senior Research Officer, Cork Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Model Farm Road, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland Abortion in ruminants is a significant cause of economic loss. Laboratory diagnosis is central to managing and controlling outbreaks, limiting their spread and preventing zoonotic infections. While many pathogens can cause abortion in cattle, no single diagnostic test can be used to identify all aetiologies. Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs) foetal investigations primarily focus on the most likely aetiologies and those with zoonotic potential. Brucellosis, an important disease, has been eradicated in Ireland following a successful statutory program; however, continuous surveillance remains crucial for both public and animal health considerations. A threshold of 5 per cent foetal mortality rate of is recommended when deciding whether to instigate an investigation, although in some instances, a cluster of cases in quick succession may be more critical in deciding to submit aborted material to the laboratory. The aetiology of bovine abortion is broad and diagnostic success rate is low, however, adequate sampling, appropriate laboratory testing, clinical history, vaccination programme and epidemiological information increase chances of reaching an aetiologic diagnosis. Aborted foetus, placenta and maternal serum constitute the minimum sampling requirements for an abortion investigation. The inclusion of placenta is critical for diagnosis of some mycotic and bacterial abortions where placenta is the primary tissue affected. Submission of blood samples from aborting cows can provide valuable information by either excluding some organisms, i.e. Neospora caninum, or reinforcing diagnosis of other agents, as is the case in Salmonella Dublin abortions. In 2018, 1914 bovine foetuses, stillbirths and foetal material (placenta, foetal organs, abomasal contents, etc.) were tested for Brucellosis and routine foetal cultures in RVLs. This section presents some of the most common aetiologies diagnosed in RVLs. Bacterial, fungal and protozoal agents are the most frequent abortifacients detected; they can be divided into primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens can cross an intact placenta and cause placentitis and fetopathy. Secondary pathogens are opportunistic organisms that count on maternal immunosuppression or placental damage to cause abortion . Figure 6.1: Submissions of bovine foetuses and foetal material aggregated and mapped at their DED (District Electoral Division), and colour-coded by Regional Veterinary Laboratory, In routine RVL foetal culture workflows, most bacteria associated with abortion in cattle can be isolated by aerobic culture from abomasal contents, placenta or foetal organs. Anaerobic culture is not usually carried out in this workflow, therefore, anaerobic bacteria may be underreported as abortifacients. Similarly, organisms that required specific media culture, e.g. Mycoplasma spp, Ureaplasma or Chlamydophila spp, may also be underreported. 6.1 Primary Pathogens Agents such as Brucella abortus, Salmonella Dublin, Leptospira harjo, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, Neospora caninum, BVDv, BHV-1, etc., are capable of crossing intact placentas causing placentitis, fetopathy and/or luteal regression; they are classified as primary abortifacients. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Some abortifacients are zoonotic and can pose a serious threat to the health of veterinary practitioners and farmers. It is advisable to always take precautions when handling foetuses or aborted material. 6.2 Salmonella Dublin abortion Salmonella abortions in Ireland are predominantly associated with Salmonella Dublin serotype. In 2018, 4.21 per cent of bovine abortions were attributed to Salmonella Dublin (Table 6.1. This type of abortion usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy with bacterial translocation from the intestine to the placenta. Typically, aborted foetuses are autolysed, occasionally emphysematous, and smell of rotten eggs due to production of hydrogen sulphide. A diagnosis of Salmonella Dublin can also be reached with maternal serology. In non-vaccinated aborting cows a single blood sample can be up to 85 per cent accurate in predicting a S. Dublin foetal culture positive result (Sánchez-Miguel et al. 2018). Table 6.1: Number of Salmonella Dublin isolates in foetal material in 2018 (n= 1970 ). Result No. of Cases Percentage Negative 1887 95.8 Positive 83 4.2 Salmonella Dublin abortions have a well documented seasonal distribution in Ireland characterised by a steady increase towards October/November, as shown in Table 6.2 and Figure 6.2; this seasonal distribution emphasises the importance of choosing the right time to vaccinate for Salmonella Dublin.

Nine Salmonella spp. serotypes other than S. Dublin were also isolated in foetuses, eight were Salmonella typhimurium and one Salmonella Indiana 6.4. 6.2.1 Listerial abortion Listeria monocytogenes and possibly L. ivanovii may cause sporadic abortions in all stages of pregnancy. Listeria spp. are widespread in the environment; clinical disease is associated with ingestion of poorly fermented silage. Following ingestion, Listeria monocytogenes proliferates firstly in placenta, then in foetal liver causing septicaemia and, lastly, death. The proportion of diagnosed abortions attributed to L. monocytogenes infection is usually is low, amounting to 42 (2.19 per cent) of the total abortions during 2018 (Table 6.3. Most listerial abortions have a sporadic occurrence and are rarely associated with listerial encephalitis. A markedly autolysed foetus is usually aborted in the third trimester. Table 6.3: Frequency of detection of other primary abortion pathogens in foetal culture during 2018 (n= 1970 ) Organism No. of cases Percentage Trueperella pyogenes 131 6.8 Bacillus licheniformis 101 5.3 Listeria moncytogenes 42 2.2 Aspergillus spp 12 0.6 6.2.2 Leptospiral abortion Leptospira hardjo has adapted to cattle, which serve as maintenance host. Leptospira spp. is labile and difficult to culture, hence diagnosis normally relies on detection of antibody titres by foetal serology or, occasionally, on Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT) on foetal kidney smears using multivalent antisera or PCR for pathogenic Leptospira spp.. Leptospirosis is likely to be underdiagnosed as cause of abortion in cattle due to poor diagnostic tests available at present. This may explain the variability in percentages of diagnosed cases from year to year and laboratory to laboratory. Abortion is frequently the only clinical sign observed in a herd, except in lactating cattle where signs of acute leptospirosis may include agalactia, mastitis, fever, haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobinuria and icterus. 6.2.3 Minor Primary Abortifacients (sporadic abortions) Some bacteria can cause maternal bacteraemia, reach the gravid uterus and foetus and progress to causing sporadic abortion. Amongst them, Truperella pyogenes, with 131 (6.84 per cent) and Bacillus licheniformis with 101 cases (5.28 per cent) are listed as the most common agents of sporadic abotion. 6.3 Protoozoal abortion Since its identification in the 80’s, neosporosis, caused by the protozoan Neospora caninum, has emerged as one of the most common infectious causes of abortion in cattle worldwide. Acutely infected dogs shed N. caninum oocysts in faeces contaminating the environment. Cattle may become infected by ingesting oocysts (from infected aborted material or environment) or by acquiring the parasite in utero. The parasite invades and multiplies within placental cells causing impairment of oxygen and nutrient transfer from mother to foetus, leading to foetal death. N. caninum may also reach foetal organs causing a non-suppurative inflammatory reaction; foetal brain, followed by myocardium, are the preferred sites to detect characteristic lesions (Figure 6.3. In 2018, N. caninum was detected in 81 foetuses, either by foetal serology, histological examination or by both methods. This figure represents a similar proportion of cases in 2018 compared to 2016, 4 per cent and 3.5 per cent of the total number of foetuses respectively; however, it is essential to bear in mind that not every submitted foetus is tested for N. caninum. Figure 6.3: Protozoal encephalitis: non-suppurative encephalitis (orange arrow), mild vasculitis (green arrow) and congestion, associated with Neospara caninum in the brain of a bovine foetus. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Most N. caninum abortions occur in mid to late gestation, but not all cows that are infected with N. caninum will abort. Nonetheless, infected cows are more likely to abort than uninfected. N. caninum abortions are more frequently seen in heifers or recently infected cows. This type of abortion follows different patterns that are dependent on level of exposure to parasite and predominant route of transmission within the individual herd. These patterns are: Epidemic abortions (abortion storms): due to primary infection of naive cows that are exposed to a single source of infection such as ingestion of aborted membranes, feed or water contaminated with N. caninum oocysts. Endemic abortions: chronic abortion episodes spanning several years and found within infected family lines as a result of recurrent transplacental (vertical) transmission. Sporadic abortions: occasional occurrence of abortions within a herd In RVLs, diagnosis of bovine neosporosis at post-mortem is based on presence of lesions consistent with protozoal damage in infected tissues (brain, myocardium and placenta) and detection of specific antibodies in the dam or foetal blood or fluids. Detection of N. caninum by PCR or immunohistochemistry in tissues is not undertaken in routine foetal submissions and is only carried out occasionally in herd investigations. Diagnostic of N. caninum abortions poses a two-fold challenge: tissue lesions, though very distinctive (necrotic foci and mononuclear cell infiltrates) are only suggestive of protozoal abortion and foetal serology depends on quality of the sample (absence of autolysis) and age of the foetus (mature enough to have produced antibodies). In addition to that, a serology positive N. caninum test result should be viewed with caution as calves are not always adversely affected by the protozoa and abortion could have been caused by a different abortifacient agent. Control options for Neospora infection are based on biosecurity, identification of infected animals and appropriate management decisions. An integrated control programme should include measures aimed at minimising chances of horizontal (ingestion of infective oocysts) and vertical (from mother to foetus) transmission thus interrupting the parasite life-cycle. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Prevent Neospora transmission by enhancing biosecurity Dispose of aborted materials (foetuses and placenta) promptly and safely, as tissues infected by Neospora and other abortificient agents pose a high risk of infection. Prevent dogs from having access to cattle areas, especially calving areas. Prevent dogs from having access to cattle feed, pastures, fields for production of cattle forage and water sources. Control rodents on the farm. Rodents may act as intermediate hosts for Neospora and they may pose a risk if ingested by dogs. Table 6.4: Combined frequency of detection of selected abortion agents on routine foetal culture. Organism No of Cases Coliforms 333 Streptococcus spp 61 Bacillus spp 11 Yeasts and Fungi 10 Salmonella spp (other than S. dublin) 9 Staph. spp 9 Listeria spp 7 Mannheimia haemolytica 6 Pseudomonas spp 5 Pasteurella multocida 2 Histophilus somnus 1 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis 1 6.4 Secondary Pathogens These organisms form a diverse group of bacteria associated with opportunistic infections of placenta and foetus; they are incapable of transplacental infection unless there is a damage to the placenta or dam is immunocompromised. Since their presence is widespread in the environment, they can potentially cause maternal bacteraemia, reach the gravid uterus and trigger an opportunistic abortion. Table 6.4 summarises the number of cases in 2018, amongst them Streptococcus spp. (61 cases isolated), Bacillus spp (61), Staphylococcus spp. (9), Mannheimia haemolytica (6), Pseudomonas spp. (5), Pasteurella multocida (2), Histophilus somnus (1), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (1). Their presence in tissues of aborted foetuses should not be considered as definitive evidence of cause of abortion. For secondary pathogens to be the regarded as cause of abortion, they must be isolated from foetal material, have produced representative lesions and primary pathogens must have been excluded. Secondary pathogens usually cause sporadic abortions; multiple abortions can be a consequence of maternal health issues that facilitate haematogenous infections. Figure 6.4: Angioinvasive: Aspergillus fumigatus invading through the endothelial cells of a blood vessel. Grocott’s methenamine silver stain. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. 6.4.1 Mycotic abortions Mycotic abortions usually occur in the third trimester of pregnancy. Aspergillus spp. (Figure 6.4 and Mucor spp. are the most common organisms isolated (10 cases in 2018). Clinical signs in dams, apart from placental retention, are infrequently observed. Diagnosis of fungal abortion is based on demonstration of fungi and presence of consistent gross and histopathological lesions. Grossly visible placental lesions include a leathery, diffusely thickened intercotyledonary membrane with necrotic haemorrhagic infarcts in cotyledons. Foetal lesions may be absent and autolysis minimal. Occasionally, locally extensive circular skin lesions may be present on foetuses. Microscopically, there is a severe suppurative placental vasculitis with intralesional fungi .

Cellcheck, the National Mastitis Control Programme coordinated by Animal Health Ireland, in association with farmers, milk processors, service providers and Government, have been focusing on reducing somatic cell counts of milk produced in Ireland. Farmers are being encouraged to collect and submit milk samples from cows with cases of clinical and suspect subclinical mastitis for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Bacteria are responsible for virtually all cases of mastitis; by identifying the agent responsible, important information about possible source of infection may be gathered, enabling a focus for control measures to improve milk quality. 7.1 Milk Culture in RVLs All RVLs follow a similar procedure for culturing milk samples. Samples are initially tested for inhibitory substances, such as antibiotics, which can interfere with bacterial growth in the laboratory. At least four different types of agar plates are used to culture each milk sample. Using a sterile swab, a small quantity of milk is spread on to each plate (Figure 7.1). These plates are incubated at 37C for 24 hours. If, on inspection, no bacterial growth has occurred at that stage, plates are incubated for a further 24 hours. If there is no change after 48 hours of culture, the result no significant growth is entered. Figure 7.1: Inoculation of agar plates for culture of a milk sample in Limerick RVL. Photo: Alan Johnson. If bacterial growth is seen on plates, further tests are carried out to identify organisms growing (Figure 7.2). If milk sample has been contaminated, cultures usually yield a mixed bacterial growth (Figure 7.3); in these cases it can be difficult to identify the significant bacterial species and the result is entered as mixed bacterial growth. Contamination usually occurs when bacteria from sources other than milk inside the udder enter the sample. This could be from skin of the udder, sampler’s hands or from inside of the container itself, if the latter is not sterile. For additonal information, see the Animal Health Ireland (2019a) webpage.

Photo: Alan Johnson. RVLs have seen an increase in the number of samples received for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In 2018, 3413 individual milk samples were received for testing (Table 7.1)}. 7.1.1 Staphylococcus aureus This organism continued to be the most commonly pathogen isolated in cases of mastitis by RVLs in 2018 (Figure 7.2). It was identified in 911, 26.69 per cent, of samples submitted (Table 7.1). Staph. aureus is the main cause of contagious mastitis and typically, though not always, spreads from cow-to-cow by contact with infected milk on cluster liners or on milker’s hands. It can be difficult to cure, particularly during lactation and culling is frequently the best option in older infected cows with persistently high somatic cell counts. Other isolates, mostly coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., were cultured from 578, 16.94 per cent, milk samples.

Figure 7.4: Relative frequency of selected mastitis pathogens during 2018. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Staphylococcus aureus mastitis Herds with mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection should reassess their milking hygiene. To prevent spread of infection, infected cows should be segregated and milked last or in a separate unit. 7.1.2 Streptococcus uberis This organism is described as an environmental mastitis pathogen. It is usually due to faecal contamination of surfaces. Sub-optimal housing and poor udder hygiene can increase the risk of infection (Barrett et al. 2005). In addition, Strep. uberis also has some characteristics of a contagious pathogen and can be spread from cow-to-cow at milking time. Strep. uberis was isolated from 407, 11.92 per cent, of milk samples cultured during 2018 (Table 7.1). 7.1.3 Truperella pyogenes This is the most commonly isolated pathogen in cases of summer mastitis. It is associated with a suppurative foul-smelling secretion and loss of the quarter for milk production. Insect vectors are considered central to its spread, hence its assotiation with the summer months. A similar syndrome can be found during the indoor (in-house) season following a teat injury. T. pyogenes was isolated from 41, 1.2 per cent, milk submissions. 7.2 Contaminated samples In 2018 the number of samples described as contaminated was high at 557, 16.32 per cent. When collecting milk samples for culture, it is very important to collect them in a sterile manner. This will ensure that any bacteria isolated has originated from within the udder, and not from the teat skin, milker’s hands or non-sterile equipment. Contaminated samples usually result in growth of coliforms or a mixture of bacterial species Figure 7.5: Monthly isolation counts of important mastitis pathogens from milk submissions in 2018 (n= 3413 ).

An aseptic technique for sample collection is a necessity. Contaminated samples lead to misdiagnosis, confusion and frustration. If dry cow therapy decisions are to be based on the results of a small number of milk samples, it is vital that proper procedures are followed. *Materials for sampling: Disposable latex gloves. Sterile screw-top plastic tubes ( capacity approximately). Cotton wool balls soaked in 70 % alcohol or medicated wipes. Paper towels. \\end{itemize} \\end{tcolorbox} Over the last number of years there has been a fall in isolation rates for Staphylococcus aureus and a rise in isolation rates for Streptococcus uberis (Figure 7.6). This may be associated with increased attention by farmers to controlling the spread of infections from cow to cow at milking time. Figure 7.7: Labeled milk sample bottle with date and quarter sampled. Photo: Alan Johnson. However, results from 2018 show a reverse in this trend with a rise in isolation of Staph. aureus and a drop in Strep. uberis. Reasons for this are not clear but may be due to weather conditions during 2018; a cold winter and spring followed by a summer drought. In many countries, Streptococcus uberis is the most commonly isolated mastitis pathogen. \\begin{widetext} \\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5,colframe=pinpblue,title=Milk Sample Collection for Bacteriology: ] \\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep] Take the sample before milking and before any treatment is given. Label the tubes prior to sampling with name/creamery number/herd number, cow number, quarter and date. Using a hand or paper towel brush any loose dirt, straw or hair from teat or underside of the udder. Washing should be avoided if possible. However, if teat is soiled it should be washed and carefully dried with paper towels. Put on gloves. Soak a number of cotton wool balls in alcohol. Clean teat thoroughly with alcohol soaked cotton wool or the medicated wipes until it is thoroughly clean. Remove cap from sampling tube. Place cap on a clean surface with closing side up. Hold open tube at an angle of 45 degrees (holding it straight up will allow dust etc. to fall inside). Using your other hand, discard first few streams of milk on to the ground before collecting three or four streams in the tube. Replace cap on sampling tube (Figure 7.7). If you feel that some contamination has occurred, discard sample and use a new tube. Place labelled tube in a fridge and cool to . This is very important. Sample should be taken to the laboratory as quickly as possible. If sample is handed to milk tank driver for delivery, ensure that it is placed in a cool box. If sample is not going to a laboratory immediately, it must be refrigerated until delivery. References "],

Kildare, Ireland Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cattle. Good management practices, early detection of disease and appropriate treatment of infection are critical to avoid, minimise and control disease outbreaks. Clinical signs consistent with BRD may include but are not restricted to: depression, pyrexia, anorexia and loss of condition, serous to muco-prurulent ocular and/or nasal discharges with/without diphtheritic plaques, increased respiratory rate and effort with a variable abdominal component, stridor breathing and/or the presence of a cough, abnormal lung sounds ranging from an absence to the presence of crackles and wheezes, increased heart rate and abortion. Following exposure, disease outcome depends on a range of pathogen, host and environmental effects. To cause BRD, pathogens must successfully manipulate or evade host defences, including the resident microflora, mucocillary escalator, antimicrobial peptides and proteins, and innate and adaptive immune responses (Ackermann, Derscheid, and Roth 2010, Caswell (2014)). 8.1 Bacterial Bovine Respiratory Disease RVL submissions are an example of a passive surveillance system. In 2018, 542 submitted carcasses were diagnosed as BRD on post mortem examination. A breakdown of the number of cases, by agent and age group, can be seen in Table 8.1. Where two or more organisms may have been identified, the final diagnosis represents what would have been considered by the pathologist as the primary cause of disease. Throughout 2018, bacterial agents were identified as the main cause of BRD in 64.3 per cent of submissions (Tables 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3). Reflecting the multi-factorial nature of the BRD complex, bacterial pathogens may also be identified in healthy cattle, but at a lower rate than those with acute disease (Timsit et al. 2017). Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasturella multocida are Gram-negative commensals of the nasopharynx and an important cause of respiratory disease in cattle, sheep and goats. In particular, causing the cattle disease known as shipping fever or bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis/ mannheimiosis. Healthy animals can carry M. haemolytica as a commensal without developing clinical signs. When animals are stressed (e.g. at housing or during transportation), and/or become infected with viruses. When animals are stressed, for example at housing or during transportation, M. haemolytica can replicate and be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract. Other opportunistic pathogens can commonly invade following damage to tissue. Figure 8.1: Characteristic cranioventral fibrinous bronchopneumonia (arrows) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. During 2018, the most frequently detected primary pathogens associated with BRD were P. multocida, M. haemolytica (Figure 8.1) and M. bovis, which accounted for nearly half of all agents diagnosed on post mortem examination (see Table 8.2 and Figure 8.3). This is consistent with data from the immediately preceding years, with the exception of M. bovis which has increased (Figure 8.8). Table 8.1: Number of cases and percentage (%) by age of the general pathogenic groups detected in the BRD cases diagnosed on post mortem examination (n= 542 ).

Mycoplasma bovis associated pneumonia can occur at any age. It has been associated with outbreaks in feedlot cattle and sometimes is followed by an outbreak of polyarthritis following the initial respiratory presentation. Mycoplasma bovis is capable of causing pneumonia on its own, or as part of the bovine respiratory disease complex where viral infections often cause the initial insult that damages the respiratory mucosa. This can reduce the activity of the cilia and weaken the immune defences of the respiratory tract. The animal’s immune status is important in the development of mycoplasma pneumonia; failure of passive transfer is a risk for the increased severity of respiratory disease in young calves. Similar to the rest of the pneumonia pathogens, nonspecific respiratory defences can be compromised by many risk factors such as viral pathogens, changes in environmental temperature, heat or cold stress, overcrowding, transport, poor air quality and poor nutrition. Mycoplasma bovis is capable of persisting with or without causing clinical disease for variable periods of time making shedding patterns difficult to predict (Carty 2017). Figure 8.2: Bovine lung.

Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Ante-Mortem samples When choosing what ante-mortem samples to collect, the suspect pathogen, stage of disease and test to be employed are important considerations: BRD associated pathogens may be identified through bacterial culture, viral isolation or molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays. In addition to nasal swabs and blood samples, transtracheal washes and bronchoalveolar lavages may be used for agent identification. Samples should be collected from a representative population. Samples from untreated acute clinical cases are ideal for successfully identifying the primary cause of disease, particularly in the case of viruses. Chronic cases often have superimposed secondary bacterial infections. (Cooper and Brodersen 2010). In 2018, other less commonly encountered organisms included Haemophilus somnus and Trueperella pyogenes (formerly Arcanobacterium pyogenes) (Table 8.2). H. somni (formerly Haemophilus somnus), causes septicemic infection with clinical presentations, including pneumonia, polyarthritis, myocarditis, abortion and meningoencephalitis. The respiratory system is usually the initial site of replication followed by spread to the CNS via the circulation. The CNS form is called thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TEME), previously called TEME. All age group of animals can be infected with H. somni, but 6 months to 2 years tends to be most frequent age of animals affected. Clinical signs include depression, high temperatures, dyspnoea, discharge from eyes and nose and some animals can display stiffness. When H. somni is involved in pneumonia it is often overgrown by Pasteurella spp. organisms. H. somni is an opportunistic pathogen that complicates viral infection and increases the severity of infection with other bacterial agents. Trueperella pyogenes is an opportunistic bacterium related to various pyogenic infections in animals. A great variety of clinical manifestations has been attributed to T. pyogenes infections in domestic animals, including mastitis, pneumonia and metritis. Usually, it is a secondary pathogen in pneumonia where tissues have been previously acutely damaged by other pathogenic respiratory agents.

Multiple nasal swabs from the same animal or multiple animals can be submitted and pooled for PCR analysis. Transtracheal washes and bronchoalveolar lavages are optimal for detecting lower respiratory tract pathogens and are preferable to identify the presence of BRD associated bacteria; they also facilitate cytological examination (Cooper and Brodersen 2010,Caswell2012). The humoral immune response can be identified through serological techniques such as enzyme linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) using blood samples; the presence of antibodies may indicate exposure, previous vaccination or passive immunity. Bibersteinia trehalosi (previously known as Pasteurella trehalosi) is a commensal organism of upper gastrointestinal tract. It is thought that under stressful conditions the bacteria can multiply rapidly and spread to the lungs and other organs, causing an acute systemic infection. B. trehalosi is an important pathogen of sheep, typically associated with acute systemic infections causing death in growing lambs. It is comparatively infrequently identified as a pathogen in cattle; however, isolates are typically associated with bronchopneumonia. Salmonella Dublin was detected as the causative pathogen in five calves diagnosed with respiratory disease. Enteric, septicaemic, and reproductive diseases are all possible manifestations of Salmonella infection, with pneumonia being a common manifestation of Salmonella Dublin infection in calves 8.2 Viral Bovine Respiratory Disease Viral agents were implicated as the primary cause of 15.3 per cent BRD cases diagnosed on post mortem examination during 2018 (Table 8.1). A range of viruses are involved in the BRD complex and may lead to the development of broncho-interstitial pneumonia. As they are inhaled, gross lung lesions typically follow a cranio-ventral distribution and can vary from mild to severe. Often, two or more viruses are present simultaneously. Importantly, viral infection may in turn predispose to bacterial infection. Similarly to the period 2010 to 2017, during 2018 bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV1) were counted among the most frequently identified pathogenic agents, found in 10 and 2 per cent of all of BRD cases diagnosed on post mortem examination, respectively (Table 8.2). BRSV infections are associated with respiratory disease in young animals. Although capable of independently producing primary respiratory disease, it is an important component of the BRD complex affecting cattle younger than one year and ocasionally adults by predisposing animals to secondary bacterial infections (i.e. M. haemolytica). Initial exposure to BRSV can produce acute pneumonia, with subsequent exposure usually resulting in milder disease. The spectrum of clinical signs can range from mild to life-threatening in susceptible cattle. In outbreaks, morbidity tends to be high, and the case fatality rate can be 0–20 per cent. Fever, dyspnoea, anorexia and depression are typical clinical signs. Gross lesions can include a diffuse interstitial pneumonia with subpleural and interstitial emphysema along with interstitial oedema. BHV1 can be divided into three subtypes by restriction endonuclease analysis; whereas subtype 1.1 and 1.2a are associated with the development of infectious bovine rhinotraceitis (IBR; Figure 8.5), subtype 1.2b is associated with infectious pustular vulvo-vaginitis and balano-posthitis (Raaperi, Orro, and Viltrop 2014). As implicated in respiratory disease, parainfluenza 3 (PI3), bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV4), bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) and bovine coronavirus (BoCo) virus were found sporadically but in very low numbers (Table 8.3). Figure 8.4: Viral respiratory infections in carcasses. Monthly number of viral pneumonia diagnoses by primary microorganism.

Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Sampling for virology Nasal Swabs Select animals for swabbing carefully, for example those early in the disease which may only present with raised temperature or comrades which have not yet developed clinical signs. Use plain swabs, moistered with bottle water or saline solution. Swad as deep as posible but at least 1.5 inches, expecting resistance. Rotate and rub against nasal passage, targeting clear and/or milky secretions if present. Multiple swabs (e.g. 5-6) from suitable animals increase chances of detecting the virus, as sheeding can drastically decrease afte 5 days. Multiple swabs (e.g. 5-6) can be pooled for laboratory testing, minimizing cost while maximazing diagnostic potential.

Figure 8.9: Trends in the incidence of bacterial pneumonia in the carcasses (all ages) submitted to the RVLs from 2010 to 2017. 8.4 Parasitic Bovine Respiratory Disease From 2010 to 2017, the RVLs observed an increase in cases of parasitic bronchopneumonia peaking at 21 per cent of diagnosed BRD submissions in 2017 (Figure 8). During 2018, Dictyocaulus species were detected in 9.4 per cent of BRD submissions (Table 8.1). Lungworm infections are associated with cattle that are or have been recently at pasture and tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. Grossly, adult lungworms are usually found in the caudal bronchi (Caswell et al. 2012). However, animals in the acute prepatent stage can be difficult to diagnose as the adult lungworms will not be visible in the lungs and their eggs will not be found upon analysis of faecal samples (Caswell et al. 2012). Re-infection syndrome may occur in previously infected cattle which are partially immune to the parasites. It typically follows a subsequent challenge from heavily contaminated pasture, leading to the development of respiratory signs. However, the infection will not become patent; adult lungworms will not be found in the lungs and eggs will not be produced. Following six cases in January 2018, parasitic bronchopneumonia was not subsequently identified until June (Figure 8.4). Thereafter, it was diagnosed every month, with the largest numbers identified in August. Figure 8.10: Adult Dictyocaulus viviparus in a bovine trachea. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. References "],
["antimicrobial-resistance.html", "Section 9 Antimicrobial Resistance 9.1 Staphylococcus aureus 9.2 Streptococcus uberis 9.3 Pasteurella multocida 9.4 Mannheimia haemolytica 9.5 Escherichia coli", " Section 9 Antimicrobial Resistance William Fitzgerald Research Officer, Limerick Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Knockalisheen,Limerick, Ireland Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is defined by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) as the emergence of resistance amongst bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to products known as antimicrobials that are designed to treat them. The OIE has also stated that ‘the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in human, animal and plant sectors has dramatically accelerated the emergence of AMR. Consequently, minimising the emergence and spread of AMR requires a co-ordinated, focused, multi-sectoral and multinational effort’. The World Health Organisation (WHO) categorises antimicrobials used in human health as critically important, highly important and important to human health. Critically important antimicrobials (CIAs) should NOT be used as first line of treatment in animals –they should only be used when there is no effective alternative antimicrobials available for target species and indication–. Additionally, some CIAs are further classified as Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics (HPCIAs). WHO Highest Priority CIA group contains antimicrobials licensed for use in veterinary medicine including 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and polymyxins. Further information is available in the DAFM webpage (Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2018). Every year, the Veterinary Laboratory Service (VLS) handles between 1500–2000 bacterial isolates from multiple species; in 2018, there were 1,826 isolates. As part of DAFM plan to monitor AMR within the Irish animal health sector, VLS focuses on particular patterns of AMR, outlined in Figure 9.2. Figure 9.1: Antibiotic sensitivity test illustrating thin paper disks containing antibiotic placed on an agar plate with growing bacteria. Note the clear zone of inhibition, where bacteria growth around antibiotic disk has been inhibited. Photo: Pat Sheehan. A number of antibiotic panels are used across VLS to initially assess levels of AMR nationally, the Respiratory, Enteric, Gram-positive and the Mastitis causing Gram-negative panels (Figure ). Statuary surveillance of AMR in zoonotic and commensal bacteria is carried out by CVRL as part of an EU- wide harmonised monitoring programme , details of which can be found here. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Disk Diffusion Test The Kirby-Bauer test or disk diffusion test, is a standard tool for measuring the effectiveness of antimicrobials against pathogenic microorganisms (Figure 9.1). Antimicrobial-impregnated paper disks are placed on on a plate that is inoculated to allow growth of the bacteria and time for the agent to diffuse into the agar. As the drug moves through the agar, it establishes a concentration gradient. If the organism is susceptible to it, a clear zone will appear around the disk where growth has been inhibited. The size of this zone of inhibition depends pon the sensitivity of the bacteria to the specific antimicrobial agent and the point at which the chemical’s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is reached. Figure 9.2: The significant AMR patterns that Veterinary Laboratory Service (VLS) monitors. 9.1 Staphylococcus aureus In 2018, there were 407 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus in the VLS. Of these, 392 (96.3 per cent) were susceptible to Tetracycline, 407 (100 per cent) were susceptible to Trimethroprim-Sulphonamide, 403 (99 per cent) were susceptible to Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (Table 9.1). 9.2 Streptococcus uberis In 2018, there were 291 Streptococcus uberis isolates in the VLS. Of these, 228 (78.3 per cent) were susceptible to Tetracyclines, 273 (93.8 per cent) were susceptible to Trimethoprim-Sulphonamide, 286 (98.2 per cent) was susceptible to Penicillin, 280 (96.2 per cent) susceptible to Ampicillin and 289 (99.3 per cent) were susceptible to Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (Table 9.1).

Enterococci are commensal Gram-positive bacteria that form part of the normal gut flora of animals and humans. Vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide antimicrobial class and is of critical importance in the treatment of infections, caused by drug resistant organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus. The use of the glycopeptide avoparicin, as a growth promoter in animals, was linked to the emergence of VRE in pigs and poultry and as a result, its use for this purpose was banned in 1996. The level of VRE infection in Irish hospitals is one of the highest in Europe. Hospital outbreaks tend to be associated with a distinct, adapted subpopulation, which are often Ampicillin and Ciprofloxacin resistant. The latter is an unusual finding in animal derived isolates and the role of animals as a potential reservoir of resistance for human epidemic Enterococcus strains remains unclear. 9.3 Pasteurella multocida In 2018, there were 181 isolates of Pasteurella multocida in the VLS. Of these, 173 (99.5 per cent) were susceptible to Tetracycline, 177 (97.7 per cent) was susceptible to Trimethoprim-Sulphonamide, 159 (87.8 per cent) were susceptible to Florfenicol, 179 (98.9 per cent) were susceptible to Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (Table 9.2). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Case Study AMR in Pasteurella multocida Pasteurella multocida frequently exists as a commensal bacterium of the respiratory tract in animals but it may act also as a primary or secondary pathogen. In 2018, almost 90 per cent of P. multocida* isolates were susceptible to all of the antimicrobials in the respiratory panel (Ampicillin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, Ceftiofur, Tetracycline, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, Enrofloxacin, Florfenicol, Tulathromycin and Tilmicosin). To date, 1 multi-drug resistant isolate of P. multocida from 2018 has undergone WGS. Resistance genes for Aminglycoside, Macrolide, Sulphonamide, and Tetracycline resistance were identified in the strain, which originated from the lung tissue of a weanling calf. The calf was one of at least seven that died during a large outbreak of respiratory disease and it had concurrent lungworm infestation. It is planned to continue with the genotypic characterisation of resistant P. multocida in 2019. 9.4 Mannheimia haemolytica In 2018, there were 150 isolates of Mannheimia haemolytica. Of these, 135 (90 per cent) was susceptible to Tetracycline, 146 (97.3 per cent) were susceptible to Trimethoprim-Sulphonamide and 149 (99.3 per cent) were susceptible to Amoxycillin-Clavulanate and Florfenicol (Table 9.2).

Of these, 191 (71.2%) were susceptible to Tetracycline, 230 (85.8%) were susceptible to Trimethoprim-Sulphonamide and 229 (85.4%) were susceptible to Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (Table 9.3). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Case Study Multiple Drug Resistant Escherichia coli on a suckler farm: Escherichia coli was isolated from the organs and faeces of animals from a farm that was experiencing high mortality rates due to cases of enteritis and unresponsive post- operative infections.

MALDI is the abbreviation for Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization, TOF is Time of Flight. A portion of a colony of the microbe in question is placed onto the sample target and overlaid with matrix. The mass spectra generated are analyzed by dedicated software and compared with stored profiles. Species identification by this procedure is much faster, more accurate and cheaper than other procedures based on immunological or biochemical tests. Maldi ToF can also be used to predict the antibiotic susceptibility of a bacterial species. In 2018, this technique was used to confirm the identity of 588 isolates within DAFMs Veterinary Laboratory Service. Figure 9.3: Sequencing platform for the generation of whole genome sequences.

These sequences can be screened for antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes and sequences compared to evaluate the relatedness of the strains, which is particularly important in outbreak investigations. WGS has been used to confirm unusual resistance patterns initially detected in the RVLs. References "],

In addition, faecal samples are submitted for clinical diagnosis; the majority of these samples come from herds or flocks with animals showing clinical signs of diarrhoea and/or weight loss. Fasciola hepatica (Fasciolosis),Trichostrongylidae (Parasitic Gastro-Enteritis) and Dictocaulus viviparus (Parasitic Pneumonia) are the most important organisms responsible for parasitic disease in cattle and sheep. Faecal samples submitted to DAFM laboratories are routinely examined for eggs (Trichostrongylidae,1 Fasciola hepatica and C. daubneyi), lungworm larvae (Dictyocaulus viviparus), and coccidial oocysts (Figure 10.1). 10.1 Trichostrongylidae Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora are the most prevalent nematodes affecting cattle in the Republic of Ireland (Murphy et al. 2006). These parasites can cause parasitic gastro-enteritis with acute clinical disease significantly reducing productivity of affected animals. O. ostertagi triggers two different syndromes in weanlings: Ostertagiosis Type 1 which typically occurs in late summer or autumn after a mass emergence of larvae on fields. Table 10.1: Charateristic comparison of the two most prevalent nematodes affecting cattle in the Republic of Ireland.

Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Ostertagiosis Type 2, observed especially in late winter and early spring and caused by larvae which experienced a delayed development in abomasal mucosa (hypobiosis). Ostertagiosis Type 2 usually shows poor response to treatment; however, it can be prevented by appropriate treatment at time of housing. In general, cattle develop immunity to parasites (Table 10.1); this immunity does not prevent infection but halts development of clinical disease. Table 10.2: Number of bovine faecal samples tested for Trichostrongylidae eggs in 2018 and results by percentage (n= 4530 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Negative 3625 80.0 Low (50-500 epg) 683 15.1 Medium (500-1200 epg) 132 2.9 High (&gt;1200 epg) 90 2.0 In the last decade, it has been shown that cows can develop a subclinical parasitic infection with O. ostertagi which can lead to significant production losses linked to reduced milk yields, weight loss, non-specific immune suppression and mortality (Delafosse 2013). Figure 10.2: Stacked count of bovine faecal samples (all ages) tested per month for Trichostrongylidae during 2018. The percentage in each bar represents positive samples (n= 4530 ). Faecal samples for investigation of parasitic burden in cattle were received throughout the year with peaks from May to August and in November (Figures 10.2 and 10.3). The peak during summer months covers the traditional grazing season and is most likely due to monitoring efforts. The high number of submissions in November coincides with the beginning of housing, which commonly associates with antiparasitical treatment. The highest amount of samples yielding positive results occurred in spring, late autumn and early winter (Figures 10.2 and 10.3). Figure 10.3: Percentage of positive bovine faecal samples for Trichostrongylidae eggs in 2018 (n= 4530 ). 10.1.1 Nematodirus spp. Also called thread necked worms are a species of nematodes which mainly affect small ruminants, but have been reported to cause disease in cattle. Table 10.3: Number of bovine faecal samples for Nematodirus eggs in 2018 and results by percentage (n= 4529 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Negative 4441 98.1 Low (50-500 epg) 77 1.7 Medium (500-1200 epg) 8 0.2 High (&gt;1200 epg) 3 0.1 Nematodirus battus is the most significant species in Ireland and affects mainly naive young lambs. N. helvetianus, which is more likely to infect cattle, has been noted across Europe but appears to be more common across Australia and Asia (McMahon et al. 2017). In 2018, there was an an insignificant number of bovine faecal samples were Nematodirus eggs were present (Table 10.3). 10.2 Coccidia Coccidia (Eimeria spp.) are protozoa (Figure 10.4 which can cause significant clinical disease in calves and lambs from 3 weeks to 9 months of age. Diarrhoea and dysentery are common signs of clinical coccidiosis. While there is a wide range of coccida species, only three species are considered pathogenic in cattle: Eimeria bovis, Eimeria zuerni and Eimeria alabamensis. Coccidia are host specific. Table 10.4: Comparison of the pre-patent periods of Eimeria spp. Eimeria Pre-patent period* Eimeria bovis 21 days Eimeria zuerni 21 days Eimeria alabamensis 8-12 days Note: * Time between infection of the animal and the first appearance of oocysts in faeces div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Coccidia have a life cycle of 21 days. Examining calf faeces for oocysts before 21 days of age will produce a false negative result. Oocyst production in clinical cases of coccidiosis may be low. Therefore, it is a good idea to sample comrades which are as yet unaffected. Clinical disease in adults is rather uncommon as immunity to the disease can develop quickly. Disease is usually self-limiting lasting 3–4 weeks, the time frame for parasites to complete their life cycle in host. Infection occurs after ingestion of sporulated oocysts, these release sporozoites that penetrate the epithelial cells of small and large intestine. Further development continues within epithelial cells where coccidia mature and produce oocysts for excretion in faeces; affected epithelial cells are destroyed leading to rapid and severe damage of intestinal epithelium. Table 10.5: Number of bovine faecal samples submitted in 2018 (all ages) for detection of coccidial oocysts and results by percentage, (n= 4506 ).

Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. As in previous years, in 2018 the majority of positive samples contained low numbers of oocysts and would not be considered of clinical significance (Table 10.5). Figure 10.5: Stacked number of bovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for coccidial oocysts in 2018. The percentage in each bar represents the number of positives (n= 4506 ). Figure 10.6: Count of bovine faecal samples exmined for coccidial oocysts in 2018 (n= 4506 ). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Avoidance of faecal contamination of feed and water, maintenance of dry bedding, not mixing age groups and, if necessary, the use of prophylacric anticoccidian drugs help to protect calves from exposure to large amounts of coccidial oocysts. This enables calves to acquired immunity without development of clinical signs and loss in production. 10.2.1 Treatment and control Anti-protozoal treatment at the occurrence of clinical signs is usually unrewarding as diarrrhoea indicates the end of coccidia life cycle in host and that severe intestinal damage is already present. Consequently, where high environmental contamination is present, control is best achieved by hygiene and prophylactic treatment. Currently, there a three anticoccidials registered for the use in bovine in the Republic of Ireland: Decoquinate: 60.6 g/kg premix for medicated feeding stuff Diclazuril: 2.5 mg/ml oral suspension Toltrazuril: 50 mg/ml oral suspension For further information please refer to the manufacturers’ advice. 10.3 Rumen and Liver Fluke The most relevant trematodes in Ireland are liver fluke species Fasciola hepatica and rumen fluke species Calicophoron daubneyi. If measured by the detection of eggs in faecal samples, in recent years the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica appears to have declined, whereas rumen fluke appears to stay static ( All-island Disease Surveillance Report,, (Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2018)). Table 10.6: Number of bovine faecal samples submitted in 2018 (all ages) for detection of liver fluke eggs and results by the percentage (n= 3853 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Liver fluke eggs not detected 3722 97 Positive liver fluke eggs 131 3 Figure 10.7: Stacked number of bovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for liver fluke in 2018. The percentage in each bar represents the number of positive samples per month (n= 3853 ). Fasciola hepatica causes disease in cattle mainly during the chronic phase of the infestation, when adults trematodes inhabit liver tissue. Clinical signs include weight loss, diarrhoea and hypoproteinaemia due to liver damage and epithelial loss in the intestine. Risk of infection with both parasites varies from year to year depending on climatic conditions, especially rainfall and surface moisture. Wet ground conditions at moderate temperatures, as occurring in Ireland during spring and summer, particularly favour reproduction and spread of the mollusk intermediary host (Galba trunculata), development of fluke in intermediary host and shedding of the metacercaria on pasture. Every autumn, to assist farmers and private veterinary practitioners, DAFM issues a fluke forecast based on analysis of meteorological data for the preceding 6 months. In 2018, as in previous years, rumen fluke eggs were more often detected in bovine faecal samples than liver fluke eggs. Figure 10.8: Microphotography of a Rumen fluke (Calicophoron daubneyi) attached to the rumen wall by its oral sucker. Photo:Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Table 10.7: Presence of Rumen fluke eggs in bovine faecal samples in 2018 (n= 3853 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Rumen fluke eggs not detected 2453 64 Positive rumen fluke eggs 1400 36 Figure 10.9: Stacked count of bovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for rumen fluke. The percentage in each bar represents positive samples (n= 3853 ). Rumen fluke is mainly described to cause disease during the juvenile phase of the parasite, when it inhabits the duodenum from several weeks to months, attaching to duodenal wall. Severe disease outbreaks have been described when young animals were exposed to large number of metacercariae in the field (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2018). However, cases of clinical disease are very rare with only 3–4 cases being reported annually in Ireland (Toolan et al. 2015). To date, adult rumen fluke living in the rumen and attaching to ruminal mucosa are not thought to cause significant disease, however there is some evidence of inflammatory changes occurring in reticulum and rumen during infestation. Both, liver and rumen fluke parasites, use the same molluscan intermediary host, the mud snail (Galba trunculata), possibly leading to an interspecific competition between larval stages of the two species, which might have an additional impact on the relative abundance of infection. Further research might be needed to elucidate this further (Deplazes et al. 2016). 10.3.1 Treatment and Control There is a variety of flukicides available for treatment and control of Fasciola hepatica. However, due to regulatory changes in recent years, restrictions apply for use in dairy cattle depending on the active ingredient and the reproductive stage of the animals. Further on, when choosing a suitable treatment, consideration of the developmental stage of the parasite is needed as only some products affect juvenile stages (e.g. Triclabendazole, Closantel, Nitroxinyl) whereas other products only affect the adult stage (&gt;12 weeks) of the parasite. Depending on the product and the time of application (e.g. at housing) a repeat or delay in treatment might be appropriate. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Sedimentation method detects both eggs, Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) and Calicophoron daubneyi (rumen fluke). The significance of rumen fluke eggs in cattle faeces is difficult to determine, adults are not considered to be pathogenic while larvae are. If eggs are found in a number of animals with poor thriving, treatment may be warranted. Alternatively, if eggs are found in healthy cattle in good condition, it may be wise just to monitor thrive. Finally, there is also evidence that there is emerging resistance against some flukicides , in particular Triclabendazole, consequently, the choice of appropriate flukicide, needs to be prudent and circumspect (Kelley et al. 2016). A comprehensive list of available flukicides, including restrictions, is available from the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). To date, there is no registered treatment for rumen fluke (C. daubneyi) available. However, there has been evidence that some products like oxyclozanide and closantel show good activity against adult rumen fluke infestation and lead to a reduction in faecal egg count. Dose rates and related side effects, as well as route of administration, appear to have an impact on treatment success (Arias et al. 2013, Malrait et al. (2015)). References "],

Leitrim Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) is a highly contagious disease in cattle that can spread directly from infected animals or indirectly (e.g. via slurry, equipment, farm workers/visitors). Most BVD infections are Transient Infections (TI) without clinical signs. BVD affects fertility, calf health and causes foetal losses (see below for further details). Infection with BVD virus within the first 120 days of pregnancy may result in a persistently infected foetus. Persistently Infected (PI) animals will shed high levels of BVD virus for life; they are, therefore, the most significant source of virus. 11.1 Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme Just over 2.3 million calves were born in 2018. Consistent with previous years, there was a very high level of compliance with requirement to tissue tag test newborn calves, with results available for 99.5 per cent of these calves. Prevalence of PI births in 2018 continued to decline, only 0.06 per cent of calves tested (1,324) were found to be persistently infected (PI) with BVD virus (Table 11.1 and Figures 11.1 and 11.4). This represents a reduction of approximately 44 per cent compared to 2017, when 0.10 per cent (2,335) were identified as PI, and of 90 per cent when compared to 2013, first year of the compulsory national programme, when 0.66 per cent (13,877) were PIs (Figure 11.3). Prevalence of herds where one or more calves had a positive or inconclusive result also decreased by 50 per cent, from 2.02 per cent (1,577) in 2017 to 1.1 per cent (805) in 2018 (Table 11.2 and Figure 11.2). Table 11.1: Animal- level prevalence of PI calves born during each year of the programme by herd type.

These enhancements, funded through the Rural Development Plan under the Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH), include increased levels of financial support for removal of PIs within a reduced period of time, automation of imposition of restrictions in herds retaining PI calves for more than five weeks after the date of their first test and mandatory herd investigations within three months of result disclusure. Figure 11.1: Animal- level prevalence of BVDv PI calves born during each year of the programme. Collectively, these measures have helped to achieve the lowest numbers of PIs alive recorded in the programme to date. At the end of 2018, only 33 PIs born during the year were still alive, compared to a figure of 53 at the end of 2017. Programme enhancements have also contributed to reducing the number of herds retaining PIs. Only 8 herds were retaining PIs at the end of 2018 (no registered date of death within 5 weeks of the date of initial test), compared to 16 herds at the same point in 2017. While this clearly demonstrates good progress, it is critical that incidence of retention is reduced to zero, with all calves being tested as soon as possible after birth and PIs removed as rapidly as possible thereafter. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Negative herd status (NHS) A herd may qualify for negative herd status (NHS) by meeting the following requirements: Existence of a negative BVD status for every animal currently in the herd, on the basis of either ‘direct’ or ‘indirect’ results. Absence in the herd of animals deemed to be persistently infected with BVD virus in the 12 months preceding the acquisition of NHS. 11.1.1 Negative herd status (NHS) By the end of 2017, approximately 71,000 (86 per cent) of some 83,000 breeding herds had achieved NHS. By the end of 2018, this had risen to close to 75,000 (90 per cent), with a further 7,000 only being ineligible due to presence of a small number of untested animals. While this is an important milestone for any herd, NHS also brings an economic benefit, as a number of laboratories that use the RTPCR test method offer testing at reduced costs to NHS herds. Table 11.2: Herd- level prevalence of PI calves born during each year of the programme by herd type.

At the end of 2018 the number of these animals was approximately 6,000. The majority of these animals are in beef herds, are male or have not had a calf registered to them. These animals are not required to be tested under current legislation and may presently be sold untested. It is important that these animals are tested as, on occasion, PI animals have been identified within cohort. During the summer of 2018 AHI contacted by SMS herds containing pre-2013-born animals to encourage their testing. Figure 11.2: Herd- level prevalence of BVDv PI calves born during each year of the programme. The number of animals born since January 2013 that do not have a valid test result and are, therefore, not compliant with legislation requirements has also been reduced to approximately 11,000. The majority have never been tested, whilst a small number has had an initial empty result and were not retested; most of these animals are born in 2018 (85 per cent), with remaining 15 per cent from preceding years. During 2018, DAFM issued letters to these herds notifying them of the need to test these animals. Figure 11.3: Distribution of calves born persistently infected (PI) with BVD virus in 2013. Each hexagon covers an area of approximately 10 km^2. Hexagons in which there are fewer than 250 cattle (e.g. mountainous/urban areas and lakes) are shown with blue border. Figure 11.4: All-island distribution of calves born persistently infected (PI) with BVD virus in 2018. 11.1.2 Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) Since 2017, all herds with positive results are required to undergo a herd investigation by a trained veterinary practitioner within 3 months of the initial positive result. These investigations, conducted through the Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) and funded through the Rural Development Plan (2014–2020), seek to review herd biosecurity, identify a plausible source or sources of infection, ensure that herds are left free from BVDV and agree farm-specific measures to prevent its re-introduction. By the end of 2018, 699 investigations had been completed, biosecurity recommendations provided to herd owners and results reported to Animal Health Ireland (2019c). Preliminary analysis of these results indicated that the majority (91 per cent) of herd owners were provided with three biosecurity recommendations, most commonly related to risks of introduction of virus associated with personnel (including farmers), purchase of cattle, contact with neighbouring cattle at pasture and role of vaccination. One or more plausible sources of infection were identified in 74 per cent of herds, with a single plausible source identified in 43 per cent of herds. In 43 per cent of cases, the source was considered to be within the herd, while in 57 per cent of cases it was outside the herd. The most commonly identified plausible sources of infection were contact at boundaries, introduction of transiently infected animals without adequate quarantine, retained PI animals, personnel (including farmers), absence of appropriate hygiene measures and trojan dams. These data provide a basis for targeted biosecurity advice to prevent accidental introduction of BVD virus to herds that are currently free of infection. Figure 11.5: Animal-level prevalence of PI calves born during each year of the programme by beef and dairy herds. Figure 11.6: : Herd- level prevalence of PI calves born during each year of the programme by beef and dairy herds. 11.2 Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis eradication programme Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) is caused by a virus called Bovine Herpes Virus-1 (BoHV-1) that spreads between cattle and usually causes inflammation in nose and upper airways. Only primary infections are commonly associated with any clinical signs and severity can vary from inapparent to very severe. Latent infection refers to a carrier state where virus survives in an infected animal, though not causing disease or spreading). All animals that have ever had a primary infection are considered to be latently infected. Reactivation of latent infections provides a source of virus for new primary infections. During 2018, the IBR Technical Working Group (TWG) developed and implemented the first phase of a pilot IBR Programme (Animal Health Ireland (2019b)) for herds participating in Phase Three of the Teagasc/Irish Farmers journal BETTER Farm Beef Programme. This pilot comprised application of an IBR on-farm veterinary risk assessment and management plan (VIBRAMP), sampling of herds and provision of biosecurity and disease control advice. Figure 11.7: Fibrinonecrotic tracheitis caused by Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR). Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. VIBRAMP consists of a questionnaire that captures details related to farm structure, animal movements, biosecurity and vaccination history, with vet and herd owner agreeing to up to three changes to improve biosecurity. A group of private veterinary practitioners was trained on this disease, application of the VIBRAMP and interpretation of test results. This was a mandatory requirement for vets to be able to participate in the programme. In addition to VIBRAMP and formulation of biosecurity recommendations for those farms, the pilot programme included partial sampling of herds for IBR. Herds were tested by applying a ‘snap shot’ which required to sample 30 randomly selected over 9 months-old animals that are used, or intended to be used, for breeding. Samples were tested at DAFM Blood Testing Laboratory in Cork with an IBR gE (marker) ELISA. This sampling allowed a statistically-based estimation of the proportion of IBR-positive animals in a herd and formulation appropriate recommendations to farms in terms of IBR-control. By the end of 2018, all of herds were sampled and tested and most had completed VIBRAMP. Results from this testing will be used to evaluate herd status, identify risk factors associated with presence of infection, identify common biosecurity risks and make informed decisions on further testing and vaccination. For example, testing of all animals in herds with a negative snap shot result would be justified, allowing identification and removal of any carrier animals and enabling herds to move rapidly to freedom from disease status. Information generated will also be used by the IBR TWG to inform options for a future IBR eradication programme for Ireland. References "],

Kildare, Ireland The Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs) of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) are engaged primarily in scanning (passive) surveillance by gathering data from post-mortem and clinical sample submissions. Analysis of this data provides an insight into trends of disease incidence and causes of mortality on Irish farms, thereby informing decision-making relevant to disease control at a national level. Tables and charts are generated with test results and post-mortem diagnoses from voluntary submissions of material (carcasses and clinical samples) to RVLs by farmers through their private veterinary practitioners (PVPs). Therefore, it should be noted that data reflects only those cases where the PVPs considered it appropriate to request a laboratory investigation and the herdowner was motivated to deliver the carcass to an RVL. 12.1 Diseases of Sheep In 2018, approximately 1368 ovine carcases were submitted for post-mortem examination. This comprised 798 lambs (from birth to one year of age) and 570 adult sheep (over one year of age). The range of diagnoses varies according to age of the animal. Thus results in this section are presented by age category. In order to facilitate presentation and comparison, conditions which affect given systems have been grouped together. 12.2 Lambs (birth to 12 months of age) Conditions affecting the digestive system were the most frequent diagnosis in lambs, with approximately 21 per cent of all lamb submissions being categorised thus. Within this category, parasitic gastroenteritis accounted for 44 per cent of diagnoses and infectious enteritis accounting for 43 per cent. Strongyle spp. and Nematodirus spp. were the most common parasites detected. Within the infectious enteritis category, there were a great variety of agents identified with Coccidia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. being most commonly detected. Other conditions affecting the digestive system included; watery mouth, rumenitis and colitis. Table 12.1: Conditions most frequently diagnosed (top 15 categories) on post-mortem examinations of lambs in 2018 (n= 798 ).

The next most frequently diagnosed conditions were systemic conditions, affecting approximately 12 per cent of cases and respiratory conditions affecting approximately 11.8 per cent of cases. div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Vaccination for clostridial diseases remains an important part of on-farm disease control programmes. Within systemic conditions, bacteraemia/septicaemia, at 65 per cent, represents the largest diagnostic subcategory. Bacteraemia arises when bacterial infections succeed in overwhelming immune defences, is present in circulatory blood and can then result in embolic infection of multiple organs such as meninges, kidney,lung or liver. Septicaemia occurs where both pathogenic bacteria and their toxins are present in circulatory blood, toxins damage organs as they flow around the body resulting in toxaemia. Colloquially, this syndrome is known as blood poisoning and is characterised clinically by high temperature, shivering, weakness and inappetence. The most common agents identified in systemic infections were: E. coli, Bibersteinia trehalosi and Mannheimia haemolytica. Figure 12.2: Lamb. White-spotted kidney: miliary 1–2 mm pus-filled white spots on renal cortical surface as a consequence of bacteraemia in a young lamb. Staphylococcus aureus isolated. Photo: Margaret Wilson. Clostridial disease was diagnosed in one hundred and six cases. Eighty-six cases were in lambs, which are typically the most frequently affected age group. Pulpy kidney disease and enterotoxaemia were diagnosed most frequently. Both types of clostridial disease are associated with lamb stress and changes or increases of feed to lambs. Both result in rapid, often sudden, death and typically occur in well growing lambs. A breakdown of detected agents is presented in the Bovine and Ovine Clostridial Diseases section of this report. Thirty-two cases of navel ill/joint ill were detected in lambs. Navel ill/joint ill is associated with poor umbilical hygiene, low colostrum intake and high environmental contamination in lambing area, allowing bacterial introduction via umbilical stump within the first few hours of life. Infections may remain localised and develop into an umbilical abscess, extend locally to cause peritonitis, ascend to infect the liver or become generalised involving joints and/or other organs. 12.3 Adult Sheep (over 12 months of age) Liver disease was the most frequent diagnosis in adult sheep with 77 cases, of which 74 were liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica). Liver fluke remains a common and serious threat to sheep health and welfare. Table 12.2: Conditions most frequently diagnosed on post-mortem examinations of adult sheep in 2018 (n= 570 ).

The next most frequent diagnosis was respiratory infection, of which 63 cases, 65 percent, were pneumonia. The most commonly detected pneumonic agents were; Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Bibersteinia trehalosi. Figure 12.4: Sheep Lung: Severe diffuse fibrinosuppurative pleuropneumonia. Pasteurella multocida isolated. Photo: Margaret Wilson. Six cases of Ovine Pulmonary Adenomatosis (OPA) were identified. OPA (Jaagsiekte) is a chronic incurable infectious lung tumor in sheep, caused by the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus. It has a long incubation period, therefore, it is most commonly detected in adult sheep. Clinical signs are of progressive respiratory illness and weight loss. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is common and often the ultimate cause of death. Post mortem examination of lungs remains the only means of accurately diagnosing Ovine Pulmonary Adenomatosis (Lee et al. 2017). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} When it is necessary to carry out post mortem examinations in the field, it is essential that veterinary practitioners take the most appropriate samples for laboratory examination and also to preserve and package them properly. Pathologists at RVLs are available to give advice in this regard. Central Nervous System diseases accounted for approximately 7.7 per cemt of adult sheep conditions diagnosed. Most commonly, CNS disease was attributed to Listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), based on bacterial isolation or presence of characteristic histological lesions in the brain.

Photo: Margaret Wilson. Thirty-one cases of poisoning were diagnosed in sheep, with copper toxicosis being most frequent. Sheep are predisposed to copper toxicity as the species, relative to other ruminants, has reduced capacity for copper excretion in bile. As a result, excess copper intake in sheep can be fatal.

Kildare. Ireland. Parasitic disease is consistently one of the most frequent post-mortem diagnosis in Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs). In addition, faecal samples are submitted for clinical diagnosis; the majority of these samples come from herds or flocks with animals showing clinical signs of diarrhoea and/or weight loss. Fasciola hepatica (Fasciolosis),Trichostrongylidae (Parasitic Gastro-Enteritis) and Dictocaulus viviparus (Parasitic Pneumonia) are the most important organisms responsible for parasitic disease in cattle and sheep. 13.1 Agents of Parasitic Gastroenteritis Faecal samples from young lambs are typically analysed for presence of trichostrongyle and nematodirus eggs, and coccidial and cryptosporidial oocysts. In older lambs (&gt; 12 weeks) cryptosporidial oocysts is substituted for fluke eggs. Results generally specify whether liver and/or rumen fluke eggs are present but, in cases where a significant rumen fluke issue is suspected, testing of duodenal contents may be preferable. The following report outlines trends in the results of faecal tests carried out at RVLs in 2018 and provides some interesting material for consideration. It is important to remember, however, that there can be a poor correlation between severe infestations and faecal egg counts. Extensive disease, and even death, can occur in the pre-patent period (time between larval infestation and appearance of eggs in the faeces) and factors other than parasitic burden may influence the number of eggs parasites produce. For this reason, particularly where there have been unexpected deaths, additional submission of fresh carcases for post-mortem examination should always be considered. 13.2 Trichostrongylidae In general, life cycles of the gastrointestinal nematodes (gut worms) are similar. Species of particular importance include Teladorsagia circumcincta (formerly Ostertagia circumcincta), Trichostrongylus axei and Haemonchus contortus which dwell in the abomasum, and Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Cooperia curticei which inhabit the small intestine. These parasites are unable to multiply within sheep and their life cycle is direct (without need of an intermediate host). Pre-patent period is 16–21 days, depending on particular species and various environmental and host factors (Abbott K.A. 2012). Traditionally, infestations would have been associated with storing lambs at autumn. However, in recent years problems have increasingly been seen in growing lambs from mid-summer onwards. All the aforementioned species produce eggs of typical trichostrongyle appearance and are undistinguishable at this stage, consequently, they are analysed together. In RVLs, Trichostrongyle egg counts tend to be substantially higher in ovine faecal samples than in bovine faecal samples (DAFM 2016). There are many potential reasons for this though a greater focus on national ovine parasite control may be advisable. Table 13.1: Number of ovine faecal samples tested for Trichostrongylidae eggs in 2018 and results by percentage (n= 1673 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Negative 642 38 Low (50-500 epg) 499 30 High (&gt;1200 epg) 301 18 Medium (500-1200 epg) 231 14 Of 1673 samples analysed in 2018 (Table 13.1) just under a third (32 per cent) were suggestive of significant (medium or high) trichostrongyle burdens. This suggests that, whilst the majority of animals appear to be bearing a “manageable” parasite load, there are proportionally still too many with potentially damaging levels of infestation, an increase of 5 per cent comparing 2018 RVL figures with 2016 All-Ireland ADSR [DAFM (2016)}. In particular, the fact that there were more samples falling into the high burden category (18 per cent) than the medium one (14 per cent) is interesting as this does not reflect typical disease pattern. This may be suggestive of either issues with treatment (the possibility of anthelmintic resistance is always a concern) or else, perhaps, such results may indicate a bias towards testing only the most severely affected animals within the population, running the risk of overlooking those with less overt disease. Figure 13.1: Stacked count of ovine faecal samples (all ages) tested per month for Trichostrongylidae during 2018. The percentage in each bar represents positive samples (n= 1673 ). Figure 13.2: Percentage of positive ovine faecal samples for Trichostrongylidae eggs in 2018 (n= 1673 ). The highest proportion of positive samples were examined in February and September (both 71 per cent), indicating peaks at either end of the grazing season (Figures 13.1 and 13.2). The immunomodulatory effects of parturition are known to result in increased faecal parasitic shedding, which may reflect the first peak. The second increase might indicate build-up of parasite numbers in pasture as the season progresses. Samples were least likely to be positive between April and June, in keeping with heavy parasitic burdens taking a while to develop in growing lambs, particularly prior to weaning. Sample numbers examined typically averaged at about 120 per month, with peaks of &gt;200 examined in both May and September, and lesser numbers (&lt;100) in both July and December. A greater number of sample submissions in Autumn would be expected, as this would typically be the time of year when most problems are seen, but reasons for the peak in May are a little less obvious. 13.3 Nematodirus Nematodirus battus is another small intestinal nematode of importance in the Trichostrongyloidea superfamily, in this report it is considered separately due to differences in life cycle and identification. For all Nematodirus species, development as far as L3 (the infective larval stage) occurs within the eggs after they are deposited on pasture, this development takes several months. In the spring, the synchronised mass hatch of overwintered infective larvae is usually triggered by a sudden increase in environmental temperature following a chilled period, a temperature differential greater than is believed to be required for this phenomenon to occur (McMahon et al. 2017). As a result, many farmers have traditionally limited the impact of this disease by rotating grazing on an annual basis and by managing their stock carefully during the period of highest risk in spring. Although it has been shown that up to 70 per cent of eggs may be capable of hatching without being first stimulated by chill temperatures (Dijk and Morgan 2008) and, in recent years, patterns of disease appear to be changing, with many farms reporting a second smaller peak in clinical cases towards the end of the grazing season. Nematodirosis typically affects growing lambs in their first season, usually at 6–12 weeks of age. Thankfully, immunity develops quickly and clinical disease is not an issue in adult stock. Nematodirus eggs can be easily differentiated from typical trichostrongyle eggs; they are much larger, brownish in colour and have parallel sides (Figure 13.3). Figure 13.3: Microphotograph of a Nematodirus egg. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. As the majority of damage with acute nematodirosis occurs in the pre-patent period and this parasite is known to be a relatively poor egg producer (DAFM 2018), caution must be exercised when interpreting faecal egg count data. Accordingly, we note that although &gt;85 per cent of faecal samples tested over the course of 2018 yielded negative results, this should not be considered evidence of freedom from infestation for the majority of those tested (Table 13.2. Table 13.2: Number of Nematodirus eggs detected in ovine faecal samples in 2018 and results by percentage (n= 1673 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Negative 1431 85.5 Low (50-500 epg) 200 12.0 Medium (500-1200 epg) 29 1.7 High (&gt;1200 epg) 13 0.8 Nonetheless, it is worth noting that thresholds dictating medium and high parasitic burdens are much lower for Nematodirus than for other gastrointestinal nematodes, &gt;150 epg and &gt;300 epg respectively. Detection of such burdens in faeces of lambs of a certain age are likely to be significant. Furthermore, presence of such burdens in animals which have recently received anthelmintic treatment should also raise concern as Nematodirus battus has traditionally shown very little evidence of resistance to Group 1 (Benzimidazole) anthelmintics, prior to the first case being reported in 2011 (Abbott K.A. 2012). The lowest proportions of samples testing positive were observed from December to March; tying with expected seasonality and life cycle. The synchronised mass hatch at the end of April in 2018 (approximately two weeks later than usual due to a particularly cold spring) resulted in a small increase in April (Figures 13.4 and 13.5). Substantial increases were then seen in May and June, as higher numbers of parasites matured and commenced laying eggs. Finally, smaller increases observed in September and October may link in with a second, smaller, seasonal peak emerging in the annual disease pattern. The largest numbers of samples were analysed in early summer and mid autumn, suggesting good awareness of when nematodirosis may be causing an issue. Figure 13.4: Count of ovine faecal samples exmined for Nematodirus eggs in 2018. The percentage in each bar represents the number of positive samples per month (n= 1673 ). Figure 13.5: Percentage of ovine faecal samples which tested positive for Nematodirus eggs in 2018 (n= 1673 ). 13.4 Coccidia Coccidia are single celled (protozoan) parasites of the Eimeria spp. Species are host specific and, although there are some 15 different types that infect sheep, only two are believed to cause clinical disease; Eimeria crandallis and Eimeria ovinoidalis. Of these two, the latter is more pathogenic, causing extensive permanent damage to the lining of ileum, caecum and colon. Disease tends to emerge from April/May onwards, primarily affecting 4–12 week old lambs with peaks at 5–6 weeks when lambs first start to graze. Acute clinical disease is not commonly seen in individuals older than 3-4 months of age (Scott 2012). Ovine coccidian life cycle takes 12–20 days and differs to nematode life cycle in several ways; the most significant of these relates to the ability of coccidia to multiply internally by asexual and sexual reproduction (Figures 13.6 and 13.7), resulting in the number of oocysts shed being many millions higher than the number ingested, leading to very rapid levels of environmental contamination within very short periods. Table 13.3: Number of ovine faecal samples submitted in 2018 (all ages) for detection of coccidial oocysts and results by percentage, (n= 1693 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Not Detected 929 55 Light Infection 478 28 Moderate Infection 176 10 Heavy Infection 73 4 Severe Infection 37 2 Early in the season, the initial source of infection for lambs comes from the relatively small numbers of parasites shed by nursing ewes and oocysts which have survived over winter in the environment. The multiplier effect means that first infected lambs produce much higher levels of environmental contamination for lambs born later in the season. Therefore, it is not unusual to see coccidiosis issues worsen over the course of the season, with lambs affected more severely and at a younger age, as the year progresses. Disease tends to be self-limiting and immunity develops quickly, although there is no cross-protection between different species of coccidia (Scott 2012). Often, survivors of clinical disease suffer permanent damage and fail to return to full health and acceptable growth rates despite successful treatment and management. For this reason, preventative management is key. As coccidia are ubiquitous in the environment, complete avoidance of disease is considered impractical. Indeed, this may not even be advisable as some studies have shown that early exposure of young lambs to small numbers of parasites may be protective and, therefore, beneficial (Gregory 1995). As this tends to be an annual and recurrent issue, maintenance of good flock records can help to pinpoint particular risk periods allowing management and/or treatment protocols to be implemented at the most effective times in subsequent years (Scott 2012). Figure 13.6: Coccidial microgamonts (blue arrow) and macrogamonts (red arrow) in the intestinal villi of an sheep with severe coccidiosis. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. Coccidial oocysts can be identified as pale, transparent, egg-shaped structures, with thin walls and many times smaller than typical trichostrongyle eggs. Large counts can be in excess of 100,000 oocysts per gram. Unfortunately, as in the case of gastrointestinal nematode infestation, it must be remembered that faecal counts can be limited in several ways. Firstly, as with nematode diseases, acute disease can occur before eggs or oocysts are observed in faeces. Secondly, as coccidial intestinal damage is cumulative, individual faecal oocyst counts may not be at their highest when clinical signs of disease are most pronounced. Furthermore, as the majority of species affecting sheep are not responsible for clinical disease, it is impossible to tell from oocyst counts whether pathogenic species are present and, if so, to what proportion of the count. This renders accurate interpretation of high counts impossible without requesting further testing to speciate the oocysts, which is not routinely conducted. Figure 13.7: Coccidial microgamonts (green arrow) and macrogamonts (orange arrow) in the intestinal villi of an animal with severe coccidiosis. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. For the above reasons high faecal oocyst counts should always be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with clinical history and signs. It may be more useful to assess oocyst counts as indicators of general flock health rather than as a diagnostic tool for individual animals. In 2018 (Table 13.3), 1693 ovine faecal samples were examined, 45 per cent were positive for coccidial oocysts and 16 per cent had counts suggestive of moderate to severe infestations. This is just over double the proportion of positive samples and almost treble the number of substantial counts than were seen with bovine samples examined during the same year. However, when comparing 2018 RVL figures with 2016 All-Ireland ADSR, there is a suggestion that proportion of positive samples examined has dropped by about 10 per cent. In 2018 (Figures 13.8 and 13.9), the highest number of samples tested was in May (205) and the highest proportion of samples testing positive was noted in June (65 per cent), both correlate well with the expected period of highest risk of clinical disease, when the infectious load has had a chance to build up and lambs are still vulnerable to disease, not yet having developed protective immunity. From February to May there is a progressively rapid increase in the proportion of positive samples examined, which may correlate with higher number of coccidia in environment due to repeated cycles of infection. After June, there is a general trend towards a lower proportion of positive results, presumably because immunity levels begin to rise from this point onwards. The lowest number of samples examined and the lowest proportion of samples yielding positive results occurred simultaneously in December, which again is logical, as this is the time of year where significant issues with coccidiosis would not be expected as there are few, if any, individuals of vulnerable age. Figure 13.8: Stacked number of ovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for coccidial oocysts in 2018. The percentage in each bar represents the number of positives (n= 1693 ). Figure 13.9: Count of ovine faecal samples examined for coccidial oocysts in 2018 (n= 1693 ). 13.5 Liver and rumen fluke Liver fluke disease in Ireland is associated with Fasciola hepatica, from the family Fasciolidae, that can infest livers of many mammals, including man. This flat leaf-shaped worm reaches an adult length of 25–30 mm and a width of about 13 mm, making it easily recognised during gross inspection of livers. There are two distinct forms of disease recognised; acute (Figure 13.10) and chronic. Both forms are not mutually exclusive and can be present in tandem within the same individual. In addition to the classic signs of disease outlined below, liver fluke has been shown to affect ewe fertility and milk yield, with consequential effects on flock economics (Hynes 2010). The most commonly identified rumen fluke of cattle and sheep in Ireland is Calicophoron daubneyi, from the family Paramphistomidae. Adults are usually 10 mm in length, pink, fleshy, tear-drop shaped and occupy ruminal and reticular surfaces. Rumen fluke infestations have been an increasingly common finding in Irish ruminants over the past decade or so (Manual 2013). For many years rumen fluke was believed to be of negative or very limited pathogenicity but, over recent years, studies have associated high burdens of rumen fluke with outbreaks of profuse watery foetid diarrhoea, dullness, inappetence and even sudden death in both cattle and sheep, typically in immature stock (Kajugu et al. 2015). This particularly seems to be the case when very high numbers of immature stages are present in the small intestine (principally the duodeunum) without necessarily featuring presence of adults in rumen, nor eggs in faeces. Knowledge of the entire life cycle and epidemiology of rumen fluke is still limited and presence of adult parasites is not believed to be associated with clinical disease. Figure 13.10: Photograph demonstrating characteristic lesions associated with acute faciolosis in the liver of a lamb. Note friable liver (blue arrow), subcapsular haemorrhagic tracts (orange arrow) and trematodes of Fasciola hepatica inside the gallbladder (green arrow). Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. The fluke life cycle is protracted with environmental development taking anything from five weeks to three months, depending on underlying weather and temperature conditions. Temperatures greater than are required for fluke eggs to hatch and for the mud snail intermediate host (Galba truncatula) to become active. Pre-patent period, from infection to commencement of egg laying, usually takes 9–12 weeks. Table 13.4: Number of ovine faecal samples submitted in 2018 (all ages) for detection of liver fluke eggs and results by the percentage (n= 1441 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Liver fluke eggs not detected 1301 90 Positive liver fluke eggs 140 10 Classically, acute liver fluke cases would be first seen in mid-late autumn, with chronic cases emerging in winter over the housing period. However, as with many parasitic infestations, traditional epidemiology of liver fluke has changed over recent years. Perhaps climatic pattern fluctuations over the past decade, with milder winters and warmer wetter summers, have encouraged the emergence of new epidemiological variations. Sheep tend to be more severely affected by liver fluke than cattle, particularly by acute disease. There is little evidence of age related or developmental immunity to liver fluke in either species, meaning adult livestock should be considered equally at risk as youngstock. Presence of liver and rumen fluke can be confirmed by identification of immature or adult stages at post-mortem or by faecal examination to identify presence of eggs. Eggs are of similar appearance but, whilst liver fluke eggs are of a consistent shape with a yellow or gold hue, rumen fluke eggs tend to be more variable in shape and clear in colour. Presence of fluke eggs in faeces is indicative of presence of adult fluke within bile ducts, and a reasonable indicator for chronic liver fluke disease. However, it is not reliable for identifying cases of disease associated with rumen fluke, nor acute liver fluke disease; for both conditions damage takes place exclusively within the pre-patent period. Furthermore, caution should be taken when interpreting faecal egg counts, as fluke egg counts tend to be low and generally provide a less reliable indicator of overall parasitic burden than most nematode species. In addition, presence of rumen fluke eggs in faeces may not be indicative of disease at all. Therefore, it is again worth emphasising the value of post-mortem examination and abattoir inspections in conjunction with faecal egg count results when investigating suspected fluke outbreaks. Figure 13.11: Microphotograph of rumen fluke (Calcicophoron daubneyi) in the small intestine. Photo: Seamus Fagan. In 2018, 10 per cent of 1441 ovine faecal samples examined were positive for liver fluke eggs and 20 per cent were positive for rumen fluke eggs. Once again, comparing 2018 RVL figures with 2016 All-Ireland ADSR (DAFM 2016), this is an improvement from the 2016 figures (14 per cent and 23 per cent respectively). It should be noted that, in 2018, a colder than usual winter/spring followed by an unusually dry summer is perhaps likely to have exerted more of an influence than changes in disease management and control. Figure 13.12: Stacked number of ovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for liver fluke in 2018. The percentage in each bar represents the number of positive samples per month (n= 1441 ). In 2018, mild to moderate monthly fluctuations were see in the proportion of ovine samples testing positive for liver fluke eggs, with the highest proportions seen in the first quarter. This ties in with expectations of the highest risk of chronic disease developing in late winter/early spring, during the housing period. Table 13.5: Presence of rumen fluke eggs in ovine faecal samples in 2018 (n= 1441 ). Result No. of samples Percentage Rumen fluke eggs not detected 1155 80 Positive rumen fluke eggs 286 20 The monthly fluctuations in rumen fluke positive samples are less easily explained and may refer to as yet unestablished elements of the rumen fluke life cycle and seasonality. As little is currently known about the significance (if any) of chronic rumen fluke infestation in sheep or cattle in Ireland, it is probably not worth commenting further here. However it could be noted that these results suggest that rumen fluke eggs were more commonly found in ovine faecal samples than liver fluke eggs across all months, bar June, in 2018. Figure 13.13: Stacked count of ovine faecal samples (all ages) tested for rumen fluke. The percentage in each bar represents positive samples (n= 1441 ). 13.6 Sarcocystosis &amp; Cysticercosis In an addition to typical ovine parasitic diseases regularly discussed in this report, a combined outbreak of ovine sarcocystosis and cysticercosis came to light in March 2018 as a result of lesions observed at abattoir slaughter. The increased presence of cyst or pimple-like lesions in lamb carcases from an intensive indoor lamb finishing unit, leading to excessive muscle trimming and carcase condemnations, raised initial concerns. Further laboratory testing involving histopathological and multiplex PCR technology confirmed the involvement of both Taenia ovis (tapeworm) and Sarcocystis tenella (protozoan) (O’Shaughnessy, unpublished data, 2019). Both parasites utilise dogs as definitive hosts and small ruminants as intermediate hosts. Hosts are seldom significantly impacted clinically by the presence of either parasite. However, sarcocystosis has occasionally been shown to result in reduced flock performance and sporadic ovine abortions (Dubey et al. 2015). Figure 13.14: Cysticercus tenuicollis in the peritoneal cavity of a sheep. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. In the case of the 2018 outbreak, the scale of carcase condemnation resulted in economic and food safety implications that had to be addressed. On farm investigations revealed risk factors such as suboptimal anthelmintic dosing of farm dogs, inappropriate storage of ovine carcases and carnivore access to feed stores. In addition, excessive pruritus, due to Psoroptes ovis (sheep scab), and lameness were also identified; these had not previously come to light and were identified during farm visits. This case clearly highlights that indoor lamb finishing units, which are a novel adaptation of sheep farming in Ireland, may be subject to variations in disease prevalence and presentation and should invest in robust flock-health planning with ongoing veterinary oversight to ensure maintenance of acceptable flock health and welfare levels.

The larger herds are intensively managed highly integrated systems whose private veterinary needs are provided by a relatively small group of specialist pig veterinarians. DAFM laboratories are attempting to increase the laboratory support to the pig industry through the provision of specialist laboratory expertise and continuing engagement with pig veterinary consultants and advisors. A primary focus has been surveillance for new and emerging diseases combined with an emphasis on the role of biosecurity in reducing risk of disease incursion and lessening impact of endemic disease in pig herds. In 2018, DAFM laboratories carried out necropsy examinations on 164 pig carcases, while non-carcase diagnostic samples were submitted from 3201 pigs for various tests to assist veterinarians with disease investigation and/or surveillance on Irish pig farms. Figures 14.1 and 14.2 illustrate the number of pig carcases and diagnostic samples submitted from each county in 2018. The Irish pig population is not distributed evenly throughout the country; this is reflected in submission rates to laboratories, with the highest number of samples coming from counties with the highest pig populations. 14.1 Post mortem diagnoses The most frequent diagnoses in pig necropsy submissions during 2018 are detailed below. It should be understood that these reflect diagnoses in animals submitted to DAFM laboratories, rather than incidence of disease in the pig population, as many factors will influence the decision to submit an animal for necropsy. Figure 14.1: Number of carcass per county submitted to the RVLs for post-mortem examination during 2018. 14.1.1 Gastrointestinal disease Enteritis was the most frequent diagnosis in pig carcases submitted during 2018, the majority of these were in suckling pigs. Neonatal diarrhoea is a significant cause of morbidity and economic loss on Irish farms and necessitates the use of increased levels of antibiotics to reduce the impact of disease in the highly vulnerable intensive production systems. Neonatal piglets have reduced capacity to produce hypertonic urine, meaning that they are very susceptible to dehydration if the absorptive capacity of the gut is damaged. There are a wide number of agents implicated in neonatal pig diarrhoea; most common infectious agents identified in nursing pigs with diarrhoea are Clostridium perfringens, Rotavirus, E.coli, Cryptosporidia spp., Isospora suis and Clostridium difficile. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), that caused devastating disease in the US during 2014, has not been detected in Ireland but is present in some European countries. Hence, disease surveillance in pigs showing enteric disease is ever more important. In undiagnosed outbreaks of diarrhoea, veterinary practitioners are encouraged to contact DAFM laboratories to avail of support and advice on sampling and diagnostic investigations, including detailed necropsy and histopathology. Figure 14.2: Number of non-carcass diagnostic samples per county submitted to the RVLs during 2018. Enteric disease is by far the most prevalent and significant health problem affecting neonatal pigs worldwide. Recent diagnostic investigations in Pathology and Virology Division in the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) and the emergence of so-called New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome in Europe have shown that, in many cases, the aetiology of neonatal pig diarrhea is multifactorial and often cannot be attributed solely to the main pathogens traditionally associated with diarrhoea. It is likely that the relatively low diagnostic rate in these cases is due to a mixture of inadequate availability of diagnostic tests, emergence of novel agents, multi-pathogen infections, complex interactions between gut microbiome and environmental stresses. Inability to determine the underlying cause has implications in terms of control, antibiotic treatment, economic costs to the farmer, reputational damage to agricultural industry and decreased animal welfare. Absence of definitive aetiological diagnosis and misunderstanding of the relative contribution of various pathogens to disease pathogenesis and subsequent clinical signs may lead to the use of inappropriate treatments, particularly antibiotics, which is likely to contribute to development of antibiotic resistance.

Streptoccus suis and oedema disease due to toxin-producing E. Coli were frequent causes of systemic disease in pigs in 2018. Figure 14.4: Fibrinosuppurative meningitis. Cranial view. Pale yellow-white exudate in the subarachnoid space, composed of neutrophils, fibrin and bacteria, and caused by Streptococcus suis type 2. Photo: Shane McGettrick. 14.1.2.1 Streptococcus suis Most pigs carry Streptococcus suis in the upper respiratory tract, piglets are likely to have been infected by their mothers. However, few carry the virulent strains capable of causing disease. An outbreak of disease is likely to occur when subclinical carriers of virulent strains are introduced into a population; this was considered the most likely method of transmission in cases described below where management systems included mixing and movement of pigs between groups. The severity of disease, even when the virulent strain is present, is variable and thought to be dependent on the presence of other stress factors including concurrent disease, high stocking density, environmental stress and recent mixing. Cases described below were considered relatively unusual in that the presentation was acute rather than the more insidious onset of disease expected. Environmental and management factors were likely to have been significant factors in the occurrence of disease. In 2018 DAFM laboratories investigated various increased mortality events in weaner and finisher pigs in large scale commercial pig units. In one such case, clinical history was of pigs weighing 15–30 Kg dying suddenly without any observed illness. No management change was identified but severity was considered worst in younger pigs and disease developed within two weeks of entering the second stage weaner facilities. The unit did not operate an all-in-all-out policy in weaner and fattener houses; instead it batched pigs on basis of weight. Pigs submitted for necropsy were in good condition although there was marked reddening of ventral neck and abdomen noted in all cases. Necropsy revealed similar findings in all pigs examined; variable interlobular pulmonary oedema and excess straw coloured fibrinous pericardial, pleural and abdominal fluids. The meninges of all pigs were considered cloudy on gross examination (Figure 14.4) and an acute fibrinosuppurative meningitis was confirmed by histopathology. Streptococcus suis was isolated in all pigs from multiple organs including brain. Streptococcus suis was identified as the cause of severe acute polyarthritis in early stage fattener pigs in another farm. Clinical signs included sudden increase in lameness and ill thrift. Necropsy identified severe acute fibrinosuppurrative arthritis affecting multiple joints with associated soft tissue oedema and swelling. Diagnosis was confirmed by pure growth cultures of streptococcus suis from joint material. 14.1.3 Respiratory disease Respiratory disease in pigs is a cause of ongoing production loss in many pig units. In 2018, DAFM laboratories continued its ongoing collaboration with research partners in investigating causes of respiratory disease on Irish pig farms. Results from this work are being disseminated to the industry. An example of a respiratory disease case investigation during 2018 was where a number of pigs were submitted following a rapid increase in mortality in a large commercial pig herd. Late stage weaners and early stage fatteners were reported as dying following acute respiratory illness. Marked reddening of ventral body areas was reported consistently and the farmer recorded 1–2 pigs dead or dying each morning in affected batches. Six pigs submitted for necropsy were diagnosed with pleuritis. There was severe diffuse fibrinous pleuritis and pericarditis with large amounts of fresh fibrin deposited on thoracic serosal surfaces. Pulmonary lesions were considered extremely severe with diffuse consolidation of 80–90 per cent of lung parenchyma and marked necrosis of parenchyma in diaphragmatic lobes in all pigs. There was mild excess of abdominal fluid and small amounts of fibrin in some pigs. Other serosal surfaces, including joints and meninges, were unremarkable. Distribution and severity of lesions were consistent with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) infection, which was later confirmed by culture and histopathology. Figure 14.5: Porcine pleuroneumonia. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, characterised by severe pulmonary consolidation and fibrinous exudate on pleural surface (green arrows) mainly affecting the caudal lobes. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel. APP is a relatively commonly diagnosed cause of pneumonia in pigs (Figure 14.5). Severe outbreaks may occur in naive populations causing a rapidly fatal pleuropneumonia. Source of infection is likely to be previously infected pigs where organisms remain as sequestra in pulmonary parenchyma or in tonsils and nasal cavity. There is marked differences in virulence of strains and disease is difficult to eradicate from herds. Severity of the disease is dependent both on the virulence of the train and the infectious dose. In experimental conditions death has occurred as rapidly as 3 hours post inoculation. 14.2 Notifiable disease 14.2.1 African swine fever awareness The current outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in Europe poses a risk to the Irish pig industry (Sánchez-Cordón et al. 2018). The disease, which has been increasingly identified over the past year in wild boar and commercial pig farms in Eastern Europe, was identified in wild boar populations in southern Belgium in 2018. The most significant risk factor for entry into Ireland is feeding illegally imported infected pork products to pigs. During 2018, DAFM veterinary laboratory service placed a strong emphasis on preparation and contingency planning to mitigate risk from a potential incursion of exotic disease such as ASF through increased training of staff on outbreak investigations and pig sampling techniques. ASF is a notifiable disease and PVPs are reminded to notify DAFM if they suspect presence of the disease by contacting their local RVO or the National Disease Emergency Hotline at 1850 200 456. An ASF factsheet for vets detailing the clinical signs of ASF is available on the African swine fever page on the DAFM website. DAFM also produced a biosecurity leaflet specifically aimed at non-intensive pig farms and an ASF factsheet for farmers, both are available to download from the African swine fever page on the Department website. Non-intensive or smaller pig herds as well as pet pig owners, may have irregular veterinary input and are likely to contact their local veterinary practitioner for advice when faced with unexplained clinical signs or deaths. DAFM laboratories are aware of the difficulties in reaching a diagnosis in these cases, especially for veterinary practitioners who may not have previous experience in treating or diagnosing the range of disease that may be present in pigs. All practitioners are reminded that, in any relevant pig disease outbreak, DAFM laboratories are available to offer advice on sampling and will carry out necessary testing, including necropsy free of charge, in order to confirm a diagnosis. Practitioners are also advised to encourage clients with small pig herds to submit any dead or fallen carcases to the DAFM laboratory network, as this will provide valuable disease surveillance material and will allow the submitting vet to assist in diagnosis and management of disease within the herd.

Kildare, Ireland 15.1 Avian Influenza Surveillance Avian influenza type A is a contagious disease caused by viruses which are naturally found in, and adapted to, populations of wild birds. Avian influenza viruses can also affect poultry and mammalian species including rodents, pigs, cats, dogs, horses and humans. Based on the severity of the disease, Avian Influenza is divided into low pathogenic (LPAI) and high pathogenic (HPAI) strains. LPAI may present with mild or no clinical signs in poultry. On the other hand, HPAI strains can cause severe clinical signs such as respiratory signs, reduced food intake, diarrhoea and nervous signs. In some cases, HPAI strains can cause sudden death with no other symptoms; in layers, drop in egg production and poor egg quality has been reported. Avian Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). H5 and H7 subtypes have been associated with acute clinical disease in chickens, turkeys and other birds of economic importance. 15.1.1 Active surveillance DAFM carries out two types of active surveillance for avian influenza. 15.1.1.1 Serology testing in poultry for the national Poultry Health Programme (PHP) The Poultry Health Programme is a DAFM surveillance programme supporting poultry trade and complying with EU regulations and ‘Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs’. PHP also includes testing for Mycoplasma and Salmonella arizonae. Last year, 13301 poultry species were tested through this programme (Table 15.1). 15.1.1.2 H5 and H7 serology testing of poultry under the EU Poultry Surveillance Scheme Ireland uses the representative sampling method described in the Commission Implementing Decision 2010/367/EU of 25 June 2010 on the implementation by Member States of surveillance programmes for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds. In 2018, 10263 samples were tested for H5 and H7 HAI. Up to 2018, results have been reported to the European Commission; from 2019 onwards, results will be submitted to EFSA. Categories sampled for the EU Poultry Surveillance Scheme include: Broilers - Free Range Chicken Breeders Layers - Free Range Layers - Non-Free Range Fattening Turkeys Turkey Breeders Fattening Ducks Fattening Geese Figure 15.1: Group of hens. Photo: Cosme Sánchez-Miguel 15.1.2 Passive surveillance 15.1.2.1 PCR testing of wild birds Wild bird surveillance for avian influenza in Ireland is risk-based. It is implemented as a passive surveillance scheme; dead, moribund or sick birds are reported to DAFM by members of the public or the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) by ringing the Avian Influenza Hotline (076 1064403) or the after-hours number (1850 200456). Birds are collected by trained personnel and submitted to Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVL) for sampling. Samples are then submitted to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) where Avian Influenza testing is carried out. A list of species of wild birds to be targeted for surveillance for avian influenza is provided by the Commission Implementing Decision 2010/367/EU in accordance with the scientific opinion provided by EFSA. The list of wild birds to be targeted for AI surveillance (H5 HPAI) is amended according to the demographics of each country. Until 2018, results of wild bird surveillance were submitted to the European Commission; from 2019 onwards, results will be submitted to EFSA. In 2018, 148 wild birds were tested. Of these, two white-tailed sea-eagles and one common buzzard were Avian influenza positive (H5N6), one mute swan was AI positive but not H5, H7, N1 or N8 (Table 15.1). 15.1.2.2 PCR testing of poultry Avian influenza is a notifiable disease in Ireland, meaning that anyone who suspects that an animal may have the disease is legally obliged to notify DAFM. Poultry samples and carcasses are submitted routinely to RVLs and CVRL by private veterinary practitioners (PVPs) and backyard flocks owners for PCR testing for the purposes of diagnosis, screening and exports/imports. Farmers are encouraged to report suspect avian influenza cases to their local Regional Veterinary Office and to make use of their local Regional Veterinary Laboratory to aid with diagnosis of disease conditions. All data on Avian Influenza surveillance must be provided to the European Reference Laboratory (EURL) annually. Last year, 696 poultry birds were submitted and tested for AI PCR.

Mycoplasma spp. in poultry, whilst of no public health concern, can present significant problems, both commercially and, potentially, for bird welfare. Therefore, poultry are screened for Mycoplasma gallisepticum and/or Mycoplasma meleagridis. -Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG)This mycoplasma is associated with chronic respiratory disease. Typically, it is slow in onset and can result in significant commercial losses. This mycoplasma can infect chickens, turkeys and game birds. Ducks and geese can also become infected, particularly when associated with infected chickens. -Mycoplasma meleagridis (MM) With this mycoplasma vertical transmission through eggs can be a significant factor. It is a disease of breeding turkeys with clinical signs possible in progeny chicks. Respiratory symptoms are the main cause of economic loss. DAFM Poultry Health Programme seeks to provide a surveillance platform for MG and MM. As part of this programme, breeding flocks are routinely tested for serological evidence of MG (turkeys and chickens) or MM (turkeys only). The plan for each poultry subgroup varies but, typically, flocks are subject to serological testing at pre-movement (from rearing), point of lay and during production (typically every 12 weeks). Frequency of sampling is set out in the Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs, and the EU commission Decision 2011/214/EU. Sample size is based on a representative sampling strategy: 60 birds per house in houses of 1000 birds or more, with design prevalence of 5 per cent. In 2018, 30620 and 1730 serum samples were screened for M. gallisepticum and M. meleagridis, respectively, at CVRL as part of DAFM official sampling (Table 15.2). 15.2.2 Passive surveillance In addition to M. meleagridids and M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae is also tested as passive surveillance. In Ireland, these three serotypes are notifiable diseases, meaning that anyone who suspects an animal may have this disease is legally obliged to notify DAFM. Beyond disease reporting, DAFM operates a network of RVLs, strategically located around the country. Farmers and PVPs are encouraged to report suspects to their local Regional Veterinary Office and to make use of their local RVL to aid with diagnosis of disease conditions.

Last year, 1400 serum samples were screened for S. arizonae. Table 15.3: Number of Salmonella culture tests from on-farm samples during 2018 in Ireland Avian Production Type No. Animals No. Positive Broiler Breeder 826 0 Layer 413 0 Broiler 127 2* Turkey Fattener 58 13** Broiler Grandparent 42 0 Turkey Breeder 12 0 Layer Breeder 4 0 * S. Braenderup and S. Kentuky; † 11 cases of S. Derby in two sites and 2 of S. Senftenberg In parallel, every year, DAFM carries out the EU-Salmonella Surveillance by collecting samples on-farm and confirming detected serotypes by culture. Programme is as follows: In at least one flock of broilers on 10 per cent of commercial broiler premises with at least 5000 birds. Three times a year for all broiler breeder premises with at least 250 birds In at least one flock per year per layer holding comprising at least 1000 birds Once a year in one flock on 10 per cent of holdings with at least 500 fattening turkeys Once a year in all flocks on 10 per cent of holdings with at least 250 adult breeding turkeys between 30 and 45 weeks of age and all holdings with elite, great grandparents and grand-parent breeding turkeys. In 2018, 1482 samples from farms were analysed; of these, 2 cases were detected in broiler breeder farms and 13 in turkey fattener flocks by culture (Table 15.2). 15.4 Newcastle Disease Newcastle Disease is a notifiable disease that affects poultry, it is caused by virulent strains of Avian Avulavirus 1 -AAvV-1- (prior called Avian Paramixovirus type 1 -APMV1-). A similar variant, Pigeon AvV-1 (PPMV1) infects pigeons and other wild birds. AAvV-1 infections present a wide range of clinical signs depending of strain virulence; from lethargy and mild respiratory signs, to egg drop production, neurological signs and sudden death. Every year, samples from suspected cases and carcasses from poultry are submitted to CVRL and RVLs for ND testing. In addition, wild bird carcasses are screened by PMV1 as a means of passive surveillance. In 2018, a total of 74 wild birds and 209 poultry were tested; of these, 7 pigeons were positive (high virulent strain) as well as 2 sparrow hawks and 1 Black-Headed Gull; they were confirmed by PPMV1 PCR. 15.5 DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS Beyond the active and passive surveillance of important notifiable diseases, DAFM carries out testing of other notifiable and non-notifiable diseases that have significant economic impact. Samples from suspect and healthy animals, the latter for monitoring purposes, are submitted directly to CVRL (Table 15.4) and carcasses of animals are submitted to RVLs (Tables 15.5 and 15.6, and Figure 15.2). Table 15.4: PCR testing of submitted samples during 2018 in Ireland Pathogen No. Tests No. Positive Avian pneumovirus 12 0 Chlamidia psittaci* 41 3 Infectious Bronchitis* 599 16 Infectious largyngotracheitis* 21 0 Mycoplasma synoviae* 621 128 Mycoplasma gallisepticum* 661 4 * Notifiable diseases Last year, 3 birds were confirmed positive for C. psittaci, 16 for Infectious Bronchitis, 126 for M. synoviae and 4 for M. gallisepticum by PCR (Table 4). These diseases are notifiable and, when suspected, tissue samples or carcasses should be submitted to RVLs or CVRL. In addition, some agents such as C. psittaci have zoonotic potential (see textbox). div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} C. psittaci Psittacosis in humans is caused by Chlamydia psittaci, an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium whose natural reservoirs are bird pets, wild birds and poultry species (pigeons, turkeys, ducks). Psittacosis has worldwide distribution and infection in humans occurs by inhalation of aerosols or direct contact with respiratory secretions or faeces of infected birds. In humans, symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, and cough. Complications have been described such as pneumonia, endocarditis, hepatitis, arthritis, keratoconjunctivits and encephalitis. In humans disease can be controlled by using of antibiotics. Incubation period varies from 1–30 days; however, spread among humans is rare. In suspect human cases, local GPs and HSE should be contacted for advice. In birds, symptoms can vary from unapparent to sudden death. It typically causes respiratory and/or liver problems or gastrointestinal symptoms, depending on species, age of birds and virulence of bacterial strain. In some cases, disease is carried by birds in a latent state, while still shedding bacteria, and then re-activated under immunosuppression or stressful conditions. When handling infected birds, high biosafety measures should be used such as gloves, protective eyewear and fitted respiratory mask. In 2018, the most common diagnosis in poultry carcasses was enteritis (23 cases) followed by bacteraemia-septicemia, arthritis and blackhead (Table 5). In wild birds, however, poisoning and PPMV1 infection were the most common diagnosis (Table 6). In a number of carcasses the cause of death was not determined.

Losses were low at about 10 birds/10000 birds. Caecal casts were noted on post-mortem examination. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic hepatitis was observed. Presence of trichomonads, which include T gallinarum, was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Liebhart et al. (2014) reported T. gallinarum infection in a flock of 2500 red-legged partridges in United Kingdom and characterised by sudden death of 15 birds within 2 days; circulation of a virulent strain of T. gallinarum in reared red-legged partridges was demonstrated. It is thought that infection is by contaminated food and could be associated with unsanitary feeding places (Amin et al. 2014). 15.6.2 Gallibacterium anatis G anatis is a normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and lower reproductive tract of chickens but is also considered to be a cause of salpingitis and peritonitis in laying hens (Deplazes et al. 2016). Salpingitis due to Gallibacterium anatis was diagnosed in an eight month old backyard hen, from a flock of 50 where fifteen hens had died over a 2 month period. This hen also had hepatic amyloidosis (most likely secondary to chronic systemic inflammation), colisepticaemia and granulomatous typhlitis due to presence of invasive trichomonad protozoa. Ascending infection from cloaca is suspected. 15.6.3 Enterococcus caecorum Over the past 15 years, pathogenic strains of E. caecorum have become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in broiler breeders. Repeated outbreaks occur. An environmental reservoir for pathogenic E. caecorum has yet to be identified (Jung et al. 2018). An outbreak of Enterococcus caecorum infection in 21 day old broilers was diagnosed. Birds presented with splayed legs and lameness, resulting in excess culling. They responded to antibiotics but when antibiotic administration ceased the problem returned. In some birds, the neck of the femur fractured easily on disarticulation. E. caecorum was cultured from pericardium, bone and joint. Affected birds had pyogranulomatous epicarditis, arthritis, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis and chondritis. 15.6.4 Chronic cholera Fowl cholera is more likely to occur in birds that are stressed by e.g. parasitism, poor hygiene, malnutrition and other diseases. Chronic cholera was diagnosed in 62 week old free range layers which were wasting and experiencing ongoing mortality. One bird, which presented with opisthotonus and twitching, had pyogranulomatous and fibrinous osteomyelitis at the base of the skull with adjacent cellulitis. Another bird had severe peritonitis and oophoritis with inspissated pus in ovaries. Pasteurella multocida was cultured from ovary, oviduct, liver and abdomen. A predisposing cause was not found in this outbreak. 15.6.5 Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is of worldwide distribution in commercial poultry, in which it is associated with respiratory diseases, and is also found in wild birds. Airsacculitis and pneumonia are the most common features of infection with ORT. Infection can be transmitted horizontally by aerosol and vertically through eggs, which probably accounts for its rapid and worldwide spread (Empel and Hafez 1999). ORT was isolated from a 36 day old organic broiler from a group which had Marek’s disease. This bird had cheese like material in its air sac. Other infections in the birds examined, which were likely due to virus induced immunosuppression, included coccidiosis, cryptosporidiosis and Gallibacterium anatis associated pneumonia.

Kildare, Ireland Tuberculosis, a chronic progressive disease which results in considerable production losses in cattle as well as in other species, is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis. This agent may be transmitted in a number of ways by infectious animals. Wildlife reservoirs have been implicated as a source of infection for grazing cattle. Infected badgers are considered maintenance hosts and are directly implicated in the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis to cattle in Ireland (Griffin et al. 2005). With respect to deer, their role in acting as a maintenance host for Mycobacterium bovis is considerably less clear, in most areas of Ireland, there is no evidence in support of deer acting as maintenance host for TB (More 2019). In certain areas of County Wicklow, a higher prevalence of TB in deer has been found. Recently, DAFM, in cooperation with the NPWS and local stakeholders groups, has been carrying out research into the prevalence of TB in deer populations. The findings of these ongoing studies will be reported in due course. Between 2018 and 2019 Tralee RVO led an investigation into TB in deer within its management region. To this end, 184 separate deer carcass specimens were sent from the south west of Ireland for post mortem examination to Cork RVL. Most deer specimens were comprised of head and pluck (composed heart and lungs), liver and kidneys; the remainder consisted of heads only. Post mortem examination involved dissection and inspection of lymph nodes in the head (submandibular, parotid, and retropharyngeal), bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, liver, hepatic lymph node and kidneys when available. Where suspect gross lesions suggestive of TB were found, these were sampled and submitted to the TB Section at the CVRL Backweston for histopathology and/or bacteriological culture testing. Figure 16.1: Chronic granulonatous inflammation. Langhan’s multinucleated giant cell (red arrow) and dystrophic calcification (green arrows) due to necrosis in a TB granuloma. Photo: Cosme S'anchez-Miguel. Of all of the cervine samples submitted, one sample yielded Mycobacterium bovis on culture, a second sample yielded an atypical non-tuberculous Mycobacterium spp.; the remaining samples had negative cultures. In addition, histopathological examination of these samples did not reveal any lesion suggestive of TB, corroborating bacteriological findings. In conclusion, of the 184 carcass specimens submitted to the DAFM laboratory service from Tralee RVO, Mycobacterium bovis infection was confirmed in one submission, a prevalence of 0.54 per cent. During the period 2014–2016, Drumshanbo RVO led an epidemiological study of TB in wildlife, as part of its enhanced response to an outbreak of TB in cattle herds in north Co. Sligo. As part of the investigation, 145 badgers were culled in the vicinity of TB breakdown herds and were subjected to both gross post mortem examination and bacterial culture of lymph node tissue. Tuberculosis was confirmed in 26.2 per cent of these badgers. In addition to the badger work, 17 deer from the same study area shot under licence from the NPWS were subjected to similar testing, none were found to have TB (Doyle et al. 2018) This low TB prevalence was reflected in the findings of the largest post mortem survey (and therefore statistically most robust) of TB in deer carried out in Ireland. A 1997 publication by Quigley et al. (1997) describes this study where 14,842 farmed deer were slaughtered and examined post mortem in Irish abattoirs between January 1993 and September 1996. Lymph nodes in the head and pluck were visually examined and gross lesions were removed, submitted to the laboratory for histopathology and cultured. TB caused by Mycobacterium bovis was confirmed in 41 of the slaughtered deer, a 0.28 per cent prevalence. The same study looked at 340 wild deer culled from Glenveagh National Park Co. Donegal and found a prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis infection of 2.8 per cent. Several DAFM coordinated studies have been carried out to estimate the prevalence of TB in deer in Ireland. The largest of these studies found a TB prevalence of 0.28 per cent in farmed deer. Two recent epidemiological studies, led by two separate Regional Veterinary Offices, found TB incidences of a similarly low order, 0.54 per cent in the south west and 0 per cent in North Sligo. Data from Co. Donegal outlined above suggest a somewhat higher, albeit still low, TB prevalence in wild deer. Research from Wicklow is ongoing and will be reported when completed. Over many years, research into TB in deer has focussed on disease prevalence, perhaps future research, using newer research tools, should focus on dynamics, ecological drivers and the spread of infection, both within deer populations and between deer and other mammalian species.

["r-packages.html", "Section 17 R packages", " Section 17 R packages The data analysis, construction of graphics and visualisation of the 2018 Veterinary Laboratory Service data have been conducted by using the R programming language [R Core Team (2013) and the RStudio integrated development environment. Eddelbuettel and Balamuta (2019), with their pinp package have provided the template for this report, which is originally based on the PNAS2 article style. Most of the charts were plotted with the package ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2018) and the tables constructed with kableExtra (Zhu 2018) and finalfit (Harrison, Drake, and Ots 2019). The webpage (HTML) version of the Disease Surveillance Report has also been compiled in RStudio by applying the package bookdown (Xie 2018). An extensive use of rmarkdow andLaTeX languages were also utilised with both packages, pinp and bookdown, for formatting and typesetting. Many other packages were also used in the preparation of this report, as shown below. References "],
